  # vs the TUI's `mark a position first — ^A params · ^K word`), and those strings are
  # part of each surface's contract. So `reason` is the machine-readable fact and the

  # settings.json, all four surfaces resolve it through the same `Decoder.shared_registry`, and
  # the remedy (`gori run decoder list`, or the Decoder tab) is word-for-word the same
  # everywhere. So the builder writes the sentence once and every surface's EXISTING
  # `Gori::Error` path carries it unchanged: `gori run fuzz` aborts with it (`CLI.run`'s
  # `rescue ex : Error`, cli.cr), MCP
  # codes it `INVALID_ARGUMENT` with the message intact (mcp/tools.cr:1644), the Fuzzer tab

    # So it is refused HERE, beside `refuse_unresolved`, whose comment makes the same argument
    # for `$KEY`: this builder is the surface-independent chokepoint every fuzz surface goes
    # through, and a refusal before the first dial is the only report a sweep of ten thousand
    # requests can act on.
    #
    # Two kinds, both answerable from the registry with no side effect:
    #   * the token resolves to nothing         → unknown converter
    #   * it resolves to an UNUSABLE saved chain → `Converter#unusable` carries the reason
    # The second is why this is not a build-time dry run over each position's default: a dry
    # run cannot tell "this chain is broken" from "this chain is fine and the DEFAULT value
    # isn't valid input for it" (`base64-decode` over a `§admin§` default raises, and refusing
    # that run would block a legitimate sweep). Asking whether the converter can run at all
    # answers the first question and leaves the second — genuinely per-payload — alone.
    # The TEMPLATE-level chain guard, and it is PUBLIC and SHARED (§2.1). It used to have a
    # verbatim twin in `RepeaterView#refuse_unrunnable_chains` — the same scan, in the same
    # words, raising the same envelope. Two copies of a refusal is exactly the drift the
    # "one spelling per fact" rule exists to prevent, so there is one validator now and it
    # lives here in `fuzz/`, with the TUI calling it (`tui/` may depend on `fuzz/`, never the
    # reverse — copying it back up into a surface is what this consolidation forbids).
    #
    # Runs NOTHING. `Template#apply_chains` returns the payload VERBATIM when its chain does not
    # run (`Decoder.run` never raises), so a `§…§` marker whose chain is unknown or names an
    # unusable saved chain would put the RAW value on the wire under a clean-looking send — a
    # corrupted request, not a refusal. This asks the registry (and `ProcessHook.parse_argv` for
    # an `exec:` step) whether each chain COULD run, never whether it succeeds on a value: a
    # refusal before the first dial is the only report a sweep of ten thousand requests can act
    # on, and asking it must have no side effect.

    # folded into the same `0` a missing token gets (`Plan#shadowed_marks`).
    #
    # That count is the number of positions made except for ADJACENT occurrences, where the
    # pass's OWN closing marker abuts the next opener: `--mark ab` over `?q=abab` splices
    # `§ab§§ab§`, and `parse` folds that into the single position `ab§ab` — the same `§§` seam
    # the skip below is about, from the other direction. Pre-existing and left alone here (the
    # span list is empty for that text, so the skip never runs): closing it turns a corrupt
    # template into a SILENT partial landing, because a token that wrapped one of its two
    # occurrences is reported by neither `shadowed_marks` (count is not 0) nor the CLI's
    # `occ > 1` note — i.e. it would trade this defect for the silence `shadowed_marks` exists
    # to end.

    # BYTE SAFETY — read before reaching for `String#gsub` here. `text` can be a CAPTURE's
    # own bytes (`--flow`, MCP `flow_id`), which may legitimately not be valid UTF-8: a
    # protobuf/gRPC frame, a gzip'd POST, a latin-1 form field. `String#gsub(String, String)`
    # delegates to the CHAR overload as soon as the needle is ONE BYTE long, and Crystal's
    # char iteration substitutes the three bytes of U+FFFD for every byte that is not valid
    # UTF-8 — so the LENGTH of the operator's token silently decided whether the request
    # survived. Measured through `gori run fuzz --request` against a recording origin, on a
    # body `v=1&bin=<ff fe 01 02>&w=2`:
    #
    #   --mark v   →  50 3d 31 26 62 69 6e 3d ef bf bd ef bf bd 01 02 26 77 3d 32   CL 16 → 20

    #
    # …and on the corrupt run gori then printed "the template's Content-Length disagrees with
    # its own body", about a disagreement it had just manufactured. This is the headless twin
