    # (`fuzz/plan.cr`, `miner/plan.cr`, `sequencer/plan.cr` all branch on `evidence?`; the

    # then stopped at the plan and the SEND seam ran unconditionally — so the intent was
    # preserved for env vars and silently reversed for session bindings, one seam later.
    #
    # It matters because captured traffic is full of `$NAME`-shaped bytes nobody typed. The
    # grammar is `$` + `[A-Za-z_]` + `[A-Za-z0-9_]*` with no delimiter requirement and it
    # runs over the BODY too, so Mongo's `$ne`/`$gt`/`$where`, JSON Schema's `$ref`/`$schema`
    # and a GraphQL operation — which is MADE of `$variable` references — are all tokens
    # here. With an ordinary extract rule named `id` bound, a captured
    #
    #   {"query":"query GetUser($id: ID!) { user(id: $id) { name } }", ...}
    #
    # left for the target as `query GetUser(<live session token>: ID!)`: a real credential in
    # the target's access log, inside a request nobody authored, and no longer valid GraphQL,
    # so the sweep's verdict was about a parse error. Measured on one capture: 12 copies of
    # the token across 6 `minimize_repeater {verbatim: true}` probes, 6 across 8 `gori run
    # mine` requests, 5 across 6 `gori run sequence` requests.

    # * `incomplete` ← `truncated`, and `timed_out` stays FALSE. "The captured transcript is
    #   short of what the server sent" is exactly what `incomplete?` already means, so it gets
    #   the existing field rather than a second spelling. `timed_out` would be wrong: a WS drain

    #   the payload gori just sent into the body it is matched against, so every `--mr` naming
    #   the payload would self-match.
    # * CONTROL frames (§5.5, opcode ≥ 8). A CLOSE's payload is a 2-byte status code plus an

    #   as the discriminator a constant 101 cannot be.
