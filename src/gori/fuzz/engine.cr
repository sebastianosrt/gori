    # preserved for env vars and silently reversed for session bindings, one seam later.
    #
    # It matters because captured traffic is full of `$NAME`-shaped bytes nobody typed. The
    # grammar is `$` + `[A-Za-z_]` + `[A-Za-z0-9_]*` with no delimiter requirement and it
    # runs over the BODY too, so Mongo's `$ne`/`$gt`/`$where`, JSON Schema's `$ref`/`$schema`

    #
    #   {"query":"query GetUser($id: ID!) { user(id: $id) { name } }", ...}

    # left for the target as `query GetUser(<live session token>: ID!)`: a real credential in
    # the target's access log, inside a request nobody authored, and no longer valid GraphQL,

    # the token across 6 `minimize_repeater {verbatim: true}` probes, 6 across 8 `gori run
    # mine` requests, 5 across 6 `gori run sequence` requests.

    #   the existing field rather than a second spelling. `timed_out` would be wrong: a WS drain

    # * CONTROL frames (§5.5, opcode ≥ 8). A CLOSE's payload is a 2-byte status code plus an
