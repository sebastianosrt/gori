  # gRPC facts a fuzz run needs off raw wire bytes: the CALL's outcome (which for gRPC is
  # never the h2 `:status` — that is 200 by definition — but the `grpc-status` /
  # `grpc-message` trailers the Assembler merges into the response head), and whether an
  # OUTGOING request's body still frames as gRPC after a payload was spliced into it.
  #
  # Both answers already existed one surface away — `run show --format json`, MCP `get_flow`,
  # the Repeater head and the TUI transcript all read them off a STORED flow through
  # `Proxy::H2::Grpc` — and the fuzz result row was the one place they were thrown away. So
  # this is a projection over the same `Grpc` primitives, not a second parser: a sweep against
  # an origin that answers `grpc-status: 7 PERMISSION_DENIED` to every call used to be
  # byte-identical to one against an origin that allowed them all.

    # that embeds anything per-response — a request id, a rendering time, a CSRF token, a
    # cache-age — has no finite set of shapes for six samples to enumerate, so every sampled
    # length was a length no sweep response would ever hit again, `--ac` suppressed NOTHING,
    # and the operator got a page of false positives from the flag whose whole job is to
    # remove them. (The rotating-banner case the multi-sample baseline fixed is the OTHER
    # failure; both are real and they want different answers.)
    #
    # So a sample is now a small BAND rather than a point, and the band's width is the
    # variability the target ITSELF demonstrated across the calibration samples — never a
    # constant this file invented. Two properties follow, and they are the reason it is safe:
    #
    #   * A target whose samples were byte-identical gets width 0, i.e. exact equality —
    #     bit-for-bit the old behaviour, on every stable target there is.
    #   * A target that jittered by N bytes gets width ≤ N. gori can only ever suppress a
    #     response the target's own noise could have produced.
    #
    # Two statistics, and BOTH are deliberately robust to one odd sample, because a
    # calibration set of six against a live target reliably contains one: a cached error page,
    # an A/B variant, a debug dump.
    #
    #   * the width is the LARGEST GAP between consecutive sorted samples, not the full
    #     min-to-max spread. Since a response is compared against EVERY sample, the bands only
    #     have to bridge the gaps BETWEEN them for their union to cover the target's noise —
    #     and the full spread is a wildly wrong number when the samples are multi-modal.
    #   * the cap's scale is the sample in the MIDDLE, not the largest. `2% of the biggest
    #     sample` reads a single 200 KB outlier among five 5 KB pages as licence for a 4 KB
    #     band around every one of them, which is precisely the over-suppression this whole
    #     mechanism must not do.
    #
    # The cap is there because "observed spread" is the right measure of jitter and the wrong
    # measure of ROTATION: samples of 100 and 250 bytes are 150 apart, and widening each band
    # by 150 merges two distinct shapes into one blanket that swallows every anomaly between
    # them. Jitter is small and absolute (a nonce, a timestamp, a few bytes); a rotation is
    # large and structural. STATUS is compared exactly at every width, so no tolerance here can
    # calibrate away a seeded 500.

    # attached: on `--mt '>=5000'` against a 10s timeout, the sleep that WORKED timed out and
    # was discarded, while the sleep that did nothing came back at 40ms and was reported —
    # exactly inverted. So a TIMED-OUT send stays eligible while a match_time spec is set, and

    # run with no `--mt` behaves as it always did.
    #

    # own terms — "slow AND 200" cannot be satisfied by a response that never came, and it
    # should not be.
    #
    # And a row whose `error` is a REDIRECT HOP's failure. `Engine#follow_redirects` keeps the
    # payload's own 3xx as the response and notes the hop it could not follow on `error` —
    # the status, head and body are all real, so `--mc 302` / `--mr` must see them. Until
    # this branch the note made the row ineligible, and an open-redirect finding whose hop
