module Gori::Fuzz
  # gRPC facts a fuzz run needs off raw wire bytes: the CALL's outcome (which for gRPC is
  # never the h2 `:status` — that is 200 by definition — but the `grpc-status` /
  # `grpc-message` trailers the Assembler merges into the response head, or, for grpc-web,
  # the TRAILER frame inside the body), and whether an OUTGOING request's body still frames
  # as gRPC after a payload was spliced into it.
  #
  # Both answers already existed one surface away — `run show --format json`, MCP `get_flow`,
  # the Repeater head and the TUI transcript all read them off a STORED flow through
  # `Proxy::H2::Grpc` — and the fuzz result row was the one place they were thrown away. So
  # this is a projection over the same `Grpc` primitives, not a second parser: a sweep against
  # an origin that answers `grpc-status: 7 PERMISSION_DENIED` to every call used to be
  # byte-identical to one against an origin that allowed them all.
  module GrpcVerdict
    # Lowercase needles for the allocation-free pre-checks. `String.new(head)` is only paid
    # by a response that really carries a gRPC status, so a non-gRPC sweep costs one byte
    # scan per response and nothing else.
    STATUS_NEEDLE = "grpc-status".to_slice
    # The other place a call's outcome can be: grpc-web declares itself in the content-type
    # and then ships its trailers INSIDE the body. Scanned for before the body is looked at,
    # so an ordinary HTTP response still costs one allocation-free pass and nothing else.
    WEB_NEEDLE = "grpc-web".to_slice

    # `{grpc-status, grpc-message}` for a response, or `{nil, nil}` when it carries no gRPC
    # status at all (an ordinary HTTP response, or a gRPC one whose origin sent no trailer —
    # the TUI calls that last case out as `⚠ no grpc-status trailer`).
    #
    # LAST value wins, matching `Codec::Message#get?`'s `reverse_each`: the trailers are
    # merged in after the initial HEADERS block, and the gRPC rule is that the trailer is the
    # call's real status — an origin that "promotes" a `grpc-status: 0` into the head must not
    # be able to hide the 7 it actually sent.
    #
    # `body` is REQUIRED, and is not a widening of an otherwise head-only reader: for grpc-web
    # the body is the ONLY place the outcome exists. Native gRPC ends a call in HTTP/2
    # trailers, which reach every reader here already merged into the head; grpc-web is
    # HTTP/1-shaped and carries the same two keys as an in-band TRAILER frame. So a grpc-web
    # sweep against an origin that answered `grpc-status: 7 PERMISSION_DENIED` to every call
    # was byte-identical to one against an origin that allowed them all — the exact failure
    # this module was written to remove, one transport over. No default argument: a caller

    # ── the baseline's own jitter ────────────────────────────────────────────
    #
    # `baseline_matches?` used to compare EXACTLY (`length == b.length && words == b.words`),
    # which answers the discrete case perfectly and the continuous one not at all. A target
    # that embeds anything per-response — a request id, a rendering time, a CSRF token, a
    # cache-age — has no finite set of shapes for six samples to enumerate, so every sampled
    # length was a length no sweep response would ever hit again, `--ac` suppressed NOTHING,
    # and the operator got a page of false positives from the flag whose whole job is to
    # remove them. (The rotating-banner case the multi-sample baseline fixed is the OTHER
    # failure; both are real and they want different answers.)
    #
    # So a sample is now a small BAND rather than a point, and the band's width is the
    # variability the target ITSELF demonstrated across the calibration samples — never a
    # constant this file invented. Two properties follow, and they are the reason it is safe:
    #
    #   * A target whose samples were byte-identical gets width 0, i.e. exact equality —
    #     bit-for-bit the old behaviour, on every stable target there is.
    #   * A target that jittered by N bytes gets width ≤ N. gori can only ever suppress a
    #     response the target's own noise could have produced.
    #
    # Two statistics, and BOTH are deliberately robust to one odd sample, because a
    # calibration set of six against a live target reliably contains one: a cached error page,
    # an A/B variant, a debug dump.
    #
    #   * the width is the LARGEST GAP between consecutive sorted samples, not the full
    #     min-to-max spread. Since a response is compared against EVERY sample, the bands only
    #     have to bridge the gaps BETWEEN them for their union to cover the target's noise —
    #     and the full spread is a wildly wrong number when the samples are multi-modal.
    #   * the cap's scale is the sample in the MIDDLE, not the largest. `2% of the biggest
    #     sample` reads a single 200 KB outlier among five 5 KB pages as licence for a 4 KB
    #     band around every one of them, which is precisely the over-suppression this whole
    #     mechanism must not do.
    #
    # The cap is there because "observed spread" is the right measure of jitter and the wrong
    # measure of ROTATION: samples of 100 and 250 bytes are 150 apart, and widening each band
    # by 150 merges two distinct shapes into one blanket that swallows every anomaly between
    # them. Jitter is small and absolute (a nonce, a timestamp, a few bytes); a rotation is
    # large and structural. STATUS is compared exactly at every width, so no tolerance here can
    # calibrate away a seeded 500.
    JITTER_CAP_DIVISOR = 50_i64 # 2% of the middle sample
    LEN_JITTER_FLOOR   = 16_i64 # bytes — a request id / timestamp / token is smaller than this
    COUNT_JITTER_FLOOR =  2_i64 # words and lines: a reflected nonce moves these by ~1

    # The half-width of a baseline band for one metric, from that metric's values across the
    # calibration samples. 0 (exact match) for a single sample and for a metric that did not
    # move — see the block above for the two statistics and why each is the robust one.

    # every distinct real attack payload has its own length, so no finite baseline set
    # would ever exact-match it (the second proven-broken scenario: 100/100 false
    # positives with a single-sample baseline). `baseline_matches?` then substitutes
    # word/line counts for length.
    #

    # otherwise transforms the payload before embedding it, so growth isn't ~1:1) reads as
    # "not reflecting" and falls through to stricter exact-length matching — under-
    # suppressing rather than over-suppressing, the safe failure direction for a security
    # tool. A target whose word/line count ALSO happens to shift with an opaque nonce
