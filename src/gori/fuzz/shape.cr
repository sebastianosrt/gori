    # A compact RESPONSE-SHAPE fingerprint (issue #1351): two responses share a shape when an
    # operator reading them would call them "the same answer", whatever payload produced them.
    # It is what `Fuzz::Clusters` groups a run's rows by, so a 10,000-row sweep reads as the
    # handful of distinct answers it actually got.
    #
    # Computed ONCE, in `Matcher#build`, over the body that call already decoded (P6: never a
    # second decode) and bounded to the body's first `BODY_UNITS` normalized units. The key is
    # the response's outcome rather than its bytes:
    #
    #   * the outcome class — a response, or a failed send folded to a coarse `error_class`
    #     (raw error text names hosts, ports and timings, and would split every row);
    #   * status, gRPC status, the truncation flags, and (folded in by `Result#with_ws`) the
    #     WebSocket close code — each its own key part, so an error, a truncated body, a denied
    #     call or a policy close never reads as an ordinary short response;
    #   * the SET of response header names minus the ones that vary per response or with body
    #     size (`VOLATILE_HEADERS`), plus the normalized `Location` and `Content-Type` values;
    #   * the decoded body with the job's OWN payload bytes masked (so a reflected payload does
    #     not make every row its own shape) — as sent, and HTML-, percent- and JSON-escaped —
    #     digit runs, hex-ish and long random tokens collapsed, and whitespace runs folded.
    #
    # Deliberately NOT in the key: `length`, `words` and `lines`. A reflected payload moves all
    # three by its own size, which is exactly the split the masking exists to prevent — the
    # cluster reports their RANGE instead.
    #
    # FNV-1a 64 rather than `#hash`: Crystal's hasher is seeded per process, and this id is
    # persisted (`fuzz_results.shape`) and compared across runs. `VERSION` is folded into every
    # key, so a change to the normalization changes every id rather than silently merging old
    # rows with new ones.

      # Units, not bytes, because the cut has to land on the same CONTENT in two responses
      # that differ only by the payload they echo: a search page that echoes its query at the
      # top moves every later byte by the payload's length, so a raw-byte window ended at a
      # different place in the page for every payload (and split the one cluster it exists
      # to form). Whether the body continued past the window is folded in as one bit.
