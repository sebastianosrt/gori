module Gori::Fuzz
  # A base request with marked payload positions. The marked TEXT is the single
  # source of truth (re-parsed each run), so it stays robust to edits — gori's
  # TextArea has no selection model. Markers are Burp/ffuf-style `§…§`; `§§` is a
  # literal `§`; an unbalanced trailing `§` is treated as literal text. The text
  # between a marker pair is that position's DEFAULT (used for inactive positions in
  # Sniper, and as the seed the user edits over).
  #
  # The template keeps wire-form CRLF line endings so `render` produces a sendable
  # request byte-for-byte (only the payload spans differ between variations).
  #
  # `parse` and `render` are BYTE-oriented, so a request body that is not valid UTF-8
  # survives them intact. They used to iterate `marked.chars`, and Crystal's char iteration
  # substitutes U+FFFD for every invalid byte — so a captured body carrying a raw 0x80-0xFF
  # run (a protobuf/gRPC frame, a gzip'd or otherwise binary POST, a latin-1 form field) came
  # out of `render` with each of those bytes replaced by a THREE-byte replacement character.
  # Every request the sweep sent was a different length from the one the operator seeded it
  # with, under a Content-Length recomputed to match the corruption, and nothing said so.
  # Scrubbing at load time only moves that corruption earlier; this is where it has to stop.

    # and allowed to have side effects — so a template with one hook marker and one PURE marker
    # that fails on its value used to fire the hook and only THEN have the pure failure refuse
    # the send (`RepeaterView#refuse_failed_chains` reads this report). A refusal decidable
    # WITHOUT a side effect must be decided before any side effect happens (the same rule
    # `Fuzz::Plan.refuse_unrunnable_chains` states one level up, for the template-level refusal).
    #
    # So pass 1 runs every position whose chain forks nothing — the pure chains, the no-chain
    # positions, and (when `run_hooks: false`) the command chains too, whose command step is
