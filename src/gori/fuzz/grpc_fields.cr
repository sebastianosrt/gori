  # A marked HTTP template PLUS N schema-known gRPC field positions, under one global position
  # index space.
  #
  # ## Why a sibling of `Template`, like `WsScript`
  #
  # Every attack mode, `--mark`, each position's `¦chain`, `PayloadSet` and `AutoEncode` are
  # defined over the payload-VALUE vector, not over a buffer — the only buffer-level operation
  # in `Generator#emit` is the splice itself. So a composite that concatenates its parts'
  # position lists into one vector, and fans a rendered value vector back out to the parts,
  # leaves `Mode`, `Generator#sniper/battering/pitchfork/cluster`, `Plan.refuse_unrunnable_chains`
  # and the payload layer working unchanged. `WsScript` made that argument first; this is the
  # same trick with a different splice, so a Pitchfork can lock a header to a typed field.
  #
  # The request's own `§…§` byte positions are part 0, and the fields follow in the order they
  # were named. So `--mark` / `--auto` keep their meaning and `plan.template` stays a `Template`.
  #
  # ## The splice: everything not fuzzed is COPIED (P7)
  #
  # A variation is built from the CAPTURE's own message octets, `Protobuf::Encoder.replace`-d
  # once per field. That call is a splice, not a serializer: it copies every other byte through
  # unchanged — an undeclared field number, a field whose wire type the schema contradicts, a
  # group, a non-minimal varint some other producer emitted, and the unparsed tail of a
  # truncated capture. Rendering every position with its own default therefore reproduces the
  # seed request byte for byte, which is the property the whole run rests on.
  #
  # ## The type is the point
  #
  # `-3` is a different set of octets as `int32` (ten bytes, sign-extended), `sint32` (one,
  # zigzagged), `bool` or an enum. The payload is TEXT, the declaration decides the bytes, and
  # `Protobuf::Encoder` — the encoder #837 specced against a reference-encoded message — is
  # what applies it. Which is also why a field the schema does not declare, and one whose wire
  # type the declaration contradicts, are refused as positions rather than swept: there is no
  # declaration to encode by, and picking the schema over the bytes is the guess the whole lens
  # exists to avoid. The Repeater's `␣Pf` form draws that line by rendering those rows read-only;
  # both surfaces read it off the same `Protobuf::Lens.read` + `Protobuf::Encoder.seed` pair, so
  # they cannot come to disagree about which fields exist and which can be typed.
  #
  # ## What `¦chain` and `--encode` mean here, and why
  #
  # They transform the TEXT, BEFORE the declared type turns it into bytes. `--prefix/--suffix/
  # --encode/--case/--hash/--regex-replace` run inside `PayloadSet`, a position's `¦chain` runs
  # in `Generator#chained_reported`, and both are upstream of the encode by construction.
  #
  # `AutoEncode` never reaches a field position at all, which is the same decision from the
  # other side: it is built from the BASE `Template` (`Plan.build`), so its index set only ever
  # holds query-string and form-body positions. Percent-encoding a payload on its way into an
  # `int32` would turn a number into text the declaration cannot hold, refused for a default
  # nobody asked for.
  #
  # The other reading — transform the wire bytes the declaration produced — is not defensible.
  # What comes out of `Encoder.encode` is a tag plus a payload the declaration describes;
  # base64-ing or hashing THAT yields octets no declaration describes, spliced into a message
  # whose length prefix then honestly measures garbage. It is also not a test anyone loses:
  # byte-level mutation of a gRPC body is exactly what a `§…§` position over the same bytes
  # already does, which is the surface this feature sits beside rather than replaces. So the
  # chain acts where the value is still a value: `--encode base64` on a `string` field sends the
  # base64 of the payload AS that string, and on an `int32` field it is refused at plan time
  # (see `refuse_unencodable`) because base64 text is not an integer — which is the honest
  # answer rather than a silent one.
  #
  # ## Framing
  #
  # A re-encoded message changes length, so the 5-byte gRPC prefix is rebuilt by
  # `Proxy::H2::Grpc.frame` — the framer the Repeater's `␣Pr:FRAME` path is made of. Not a second
  # framer, and not `Config#reframe_grpc?`: that knob repairs a prefix a byte-level payload left
  # stale, and is documented as opt-in because a deliberately-wrong prefix is one of the standard
  # gRPC parser tests. Here the message was re-encoded THROUGH the schema at the operator's
  # request, so a prefix that measured the old one would make every request in the sweep a
  # framing-layer rejection and nothing else. The flag byte is the reason `build` refuses a
  # non-zero one: `Grpc.frame` composes the flag out of the compressed and trailer bits, so a
  # frame carrying anything else could not be re-emitted verbatim, and gori refuses rather than
  # normalizes.
