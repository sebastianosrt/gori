    # Records a fuzz RESULT as a History flow — the opt-in evidence half of `record_history`

    # `fuzz_start.record_history` project the same request/response the same way.
    #
    # A `Fuzz::Result` only carries its rendered `request` / `body` bytes when the matcher was
    # built with `keep_bodies` other than `:none` (retention is the axis) — a caller that wants
    # to record MUST build the engine with the matching policy, or `request` is nil here and
    # nothing is written.

      # not a second copy, so the two surfaces cannot drift to different ceilings.
      MAX = 5_000

      # The one sentence every surface uses to refuse recording a WebSocket sweep, so the CLI
      # and MCP cannot word it differently — the same job `CLI::Run.ws_notice_dropped_note` does

      # Never raises: recording must not break a sweep — a failure yields nil. But it must not be
      # SILENT either, or a locked/read-only DB reports as a clean "recorded 0 flows" with no
      # reason (#749 review). The caller supplies the reporting, because the two surfaces rate-
      # limit differently: MCP counts against its per-job drain budget, the CLI says it once.
      # `source` is a PARAMETER and not a hardcoded `Fuzzer`, because `Fuzz::Sender` is not the
      # Fuzzer's sender — the Miner, the Sequencer, Authorize, Minimize and Probe's active rules
      # all sweep through it (`Fuzz::Engine`). Hardcoding would make the first of those to learn
      # recording label its flows `fuzzer`, which is the drift these columns exist to stop.
      # `surface` names which of gori's three faces asked for the sweep.
      # `websocket` says the RUN took the framed WebSocket path, and it is the whole of the
      # WebSocket test here. A variation of such a run is not a flow: recording one would write
      # a request head declaring `Upgrade: websocket` — so `Store::FlowDetail#websocket?` answers
      # TRUE — with a 101 response carrying a SYNTHESIZED body no 101 ever has, and ZERO
      # `ws_messages` rows beside it. That is a manufactured flow: it renders in History as a
      # WebSocket with an empty transcript, and re-seeding a repeater from it yields a session
      # with no frames. `gori run repeater send` refuses the same thing for the same reason.
      #
      # DELIBERATELY NOT a byte test on the request head. `WsEngine.replayable?(request)` is
      # the obvious spelling and it is WRONG here, because the bytes do not say which engine
      # ran: `--ws-http-only` / `ws_http_only:true` sweeps that exact handshake as an ORDINARY
      # HTTP request, and the flow it produces is an ordinary request/response exchange with
      # nothing manufactured about it. Sniffing the bytes silently recorded nothing for that
      # run — while both surfaces' refusal messages point the operator AT `--ws-http-only` as
      # the way to get recording back.
      #
      # The honest version for a real WS run — the handshake as a flow PLUS the transcript
      # through `Store#insert_ws_messages` — needs `Fuzz::Result` to retain the transcript under
      # `keep_bodies`, which is a retention-budget change of its own. Refused, not faked.
      #
      # Every surface also refuses `record_history` + WebSocket up front, before the sweep
      # dials: "swept 10,000 sessions, recorded 0" is a refusal that arrives after the traffic.
      # This is the backstop.
