  # `enqueue_*` (the h2 relay, which cannot block its pump fiber — see `enqueue_request`), and

    # (`x-test: café`, a UTF-8 cookie) put the boundary a byte short of the real blank line, and
    # a head-only edit with no body at all came back reporting one: `Item#refuse_edit` then
    # refused an edit the operator could not fix except by deleting the character. Held bytes

    # length is over `ClientConn::MAX_REWRITE_BODY`, or an h2 stream released past
    # `H2::StreamGate::MAX_DEFERRED_BYTES`. Both fail OPEN, which is the right disposition —
    # capping the read would truncate the very upload the operator wanted to edit — but both
    # recorded it with `::Log.warn` alone, and under `gori tui` a `Log` line reaches neither
    # the notification centre nor stderr. It lands in `~/.gori/gori.log`, which is precisely
    # the silence the WebSocket gate refuses in `WS::MessageGate#note` ("a `gori.log` only an
    # operator who knew to tail it ever reads"). So with catch ON a message went to the origin
    # unheld and the only thing on screen was a queue row that never appeared.
    #
    # They collect HERE because the Interceptor is the object both gates already hold and the
    # shell already reads every tick, and because "what the catch missed" is the catch's own
    # accounting. Each site latches its warning once per connection, and the buffer is capped
    # anyway: a proxy fiber must not grow it without bound when nobody is draining (a
