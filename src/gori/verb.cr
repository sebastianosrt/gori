module Gori
  # The verb system — the TUI's one source of truth for an action (P1). A single
  # Definition drives a keybinding, a command-palette entry AND a space-menu entry;
  # all three run the same Definition#call, so the TUI has no per-surface dispatch.
  #
  # It stops at the TUI, deliberately. `gori run` and `gori mcp` declare their own
  # commands and reach parity by calling the same engines (DESIGN.md §2.1), not by
  # reading this registry. The blocker is not wiring: a verb names no target, it
  # reads one from TUI selection state (`repeater_send` sends the ACTIVE sub-tab),
  # and a caller with an id but no selection cannot express that — see the argument
  # schema Definition does not have. Measured and decided in DESIGN.md §7
  # (2026-07-26), issue #357.

      # menu (helix leader). Optional: a verb already carrying a plain single-char
      # chord (y / f / / …) gets its menu key from that for free (see #menu_key);
      # this overrides for verbs whose only chord is ctrl/shift or none.
      getter mnemonic : Char?
      # Which group within the scope's space menu shows this verb: :common (every
      # displayable view, tab-wide) or a context section (a focus-area like
      # :request/:response/:template, or :tab/:subtab for the tab-bar/strip tiers).

      # :view / :send / :triage / :copy / :scope / :danger / :wipe (see

      # ride a bare letter (the established `d`), while :wipe empties a whole
      # tab/project store and must answer a MODIFIED chord — ⇧X across the app (#899),
      # never a bare letter (registry_sweep_spec enforces the chord rule). Verbs that
      # only clear a text selection, marks, or scratch editor state are NOT destructive
      # and stay out of both. Orthogonal to `section`, which is a FOCUS-AREA
      # axis: `section` answers "which pane is focused" (and a section's verbs only
      # appear when that pane IS focused), while `group` answers "what kind of action
      # is this" and never gates visibility. The single-region scopes — History's Body
      # (19 entries), HistoryDetail (16), Probe (14), Sitemap (10) — have no focus
      # sub-areas at all, so `section` can never break their one flat list up; `group`
      # is what makes them scannable. Defaults to :none, which renders exactly as
      # before (no header, no subdivision), so an untagged scope is unchanged.
      getter group : Symbol
      # The sections (the active controller's `command_section`) in which this verb's CHORDS
      # fire, or nil for anywhere its scope does. A FOCUS gate on the key alone: the palette
      # and the space menu still run the verb wherever `available?` says (the menu already

      getter menu : Placement
      # The verb whose chord ALSO reaches this one, for a pane-aware pair: the Repeater's `^X`
      # (`repeater.toggle-hex`) toggles the hex of whichever pane has focus, so the response
      # pane's hex row (`repeater.toggle-resp-hex`) advertises `^X` although a scope binds a

      # this verb has no chord of its own, so the space menu's hint column, Help and the
