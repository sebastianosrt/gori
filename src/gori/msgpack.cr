  # Schema-less MessagePack reader (https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack/blob/master/spec.md),
  # rendering a captured body as JSON text. A pure byte parser over a `Bytes` slice (no I/O),
  # sibling to `Gori::Protobuf`: both exist because a proxy is handed binary bodies with no
  # schema in front of them, and "binary — press ^X for hex" is the answer that makes an
  # operator stop reading.
  #
  # ## The projection is explicit, because MessagePack carries what JSON does not
  #
  # A reader that quietly folded a `bin` into a string, or a 64-bit unsigned into a float, or
  # an `ext` into nothing, would be inventing evidence. Every type JSON has no room for gets a
  # named wrapper instead — `{"$bin": …}`, `{"$ext": …}` — so what is on the wire is legible
  # from the output alone. That is the same rule `Protobuf` follows when it reports a
  # length-delimited field as bytes AND string AND message rather than picking a winner.
  #
  # One ambiguity is accepted rather than papered over: a document whose own map key is
  # literally `$bin` or `$ext` renders the shape a wrapper does. Escaping every key in every
  # body to defend against the one body that does this would make the common body harder to
  # read, and the bytes stay reachable throughout (the hex view, and the store). The CBOR
  # sibling makes the same trade, and both are documented in the proxy guide.
  #
  # Never raises on hostile or truncated input (P7): the parse stops and the caller is told it
  # is partial, with everything decoded up to that point kept. Depth and item counts are
  # bounded, and a declared length is checked against the bytes that actually remain before
  # anything is allocated — a 5-byte header can claim 4 GiB.

    # A non-string map KEY is rendered as its own JSON text and that text becomes the member
    # name (see `map`), so a map keyed on a MAP nests the inner rendering inside a JSON string
    # once per level — and each level's escaping roughly doubles it. `81 81 81 …`, one byte per
    # level, therefore grows the output as 2^depth: 57 bytes produced 1.6 GB, and 59 bytes
    # reached the point where `String::Builder` refuses to grow and raised `IO::EOFError`
    # straight out of `render` — the one thing this module promises never to do. `MAX_DEPTH`
    # cannot fix it (the blow-up is well inside 32 levels) and a per-key length cap cannot
    # either (`MAX_ITEMS` keys at any cap is still that cap × 100 000).

      #   * `LEN_TOO_WIDE` — a value no Int32 can hold, so no input this process can be handed
      #     could ever satisfy it. That is a header claiming something impossible, which is what
      #     a body of some other format looks like.
