module Gori
  # An external process as a byte transform: bytes in on stdin, replacement bytes out on
  # stdout (#818).
  #
  # This is gori's whole extension axis. Burp answers "run MY code over these bytes" with
  # BApps/Bambdas, Caido with a JS plugin SDK; gori answers with the UNIX process boundary —
  # language-agnostic, reuses every script the operator already owns, and needs no in-process
  # runtime, no stable ABI and no recompile (P0). Every seam calls it and NONE re-implements it
  # (P1/§2): the Rewriter `pipe` op (`rules.cr`), the Decoder chain `exec:` step
  # (`decoder/chain.cr`), the Probe `exec` custom rule (`probe/custom_rule.cr`), the Miner's
  # per-probe request hook (`miner/inject.cr`, driven by `miner/hook_backend.cr`), and — not an
  # operator hook at all, but the same bounded-spawn need — the Codex delivery route's `lsof`
  # and `codex queue` (`mcp/codex_queue.cr`). `spec/settings/profile_commands_spec.cr` counts
  # these call sites the way it counts `Process.run`, so a sixth arrives with the same question
  # asked of it: where does the program come from, and can a profile set it?
  #
  # TRUST: a hook runs with the OPERATOR'S OWN privileges. It is not sandboxed, jailed or
  # confined in any way, deliberately — the same trust level a `--config` file, a Rewriter
  # rule or a `body_file` path already has. gori never invents a hook; every one of them is
  # configuration a human wrote and every surface lists it plainly (P4).
  #
  # The four load-bearing invariants, in the order they matter:
  #
  #   1. P6 — NEVER STALL THE DATA PATH. A hard wall-clock timeout is mandatory and is
  #      enforced HERE, not by the caller's good intentions. `run` returns within
  #      `timeout + KILL_GRACE + 2 × COLLECT_GRACE` no matter what the child does (the two
  #      graces are the stdout and stderr hand-overs, taken in sequence): it SIGKILLs a
  #      child that overruns, and abandons a pipe that will not close rather than waiting on
  #      it. On timeout, non-zero exit, oversized output or spawn failure the result is NOT
  #      ok?, and every proxy-path caller is contractually required to pass the ORIGINAL bytes
  #      through unchanged and surface `Result#failure` as a non-fatal notice. A wedged hook
  #      costs one message one timeout; it can never cost the proxy a flow.
  #   2. BOUNDED OUTPUT. stdout is capped at MAX_OUTPUT (32 MiB, the same order as
  #      `Decoder::MAX_OUT` and `Codec::ContentDecode::MAX_OUT`) so a runaway child cannot
  #      exhaust memory. Overrunning it is a FAILURE, not a truncation: half a body is
  #      corruption, and P7 says the original octets win over a mangled derivative.
  #   3. NO SHELL. `argv` is exec'd directly (`Process.new(cmd, args, shell: false)`). There is
  #      no `sh -c` anywhere on this path, so operator payloads flowing through a hook's
  #      arguments are never shell-interpreted — no globbing, no word splitting, no `$(…)`, no
  #      `;`/`&&`/redirection. `parse_argv` below is the tokenizer, and it is deliberately NOT
  #      a shell.
  #   4. P7 — the hook sees the raw captured octets and its stdout is taken as raw octets.
  #      gori does not decode, re-encode, scrub or validate UTF-8 around it.
  module ProcessHook
    # stdout ceiling for one hook run. See invariant 2.
    MAX_OUTPUT = 32 * 1024 * 1024

    # stderr ceiling. Small on purpose: stderr is only ever read to put a REASON in a notice,
    # never to produce data, so a child that scribbles megabytes there gets its diagnostic
    # truncated rather than gori's memory.

    # re-signer or a recompressor and short enough that a wedged hook is an annoyance rather
    # than an outage. Overridable per call, and per install through
    # `Settings.hook_timeout_secs`.
    DEFAULT_TIMEOUT = 5.seconds

    # The ceiling an operator-supplied timeout is clamped to. P6 is not negotiable by
    # configuration: whatever settings.json says, a hook cannot hold a message longer than
    # this.
    MAX_TIMEOUT = 60.seconds

    # After SIGKILL, how long `wait` is given to reap. SIGKILL cannot be blocked, so this only
    # ever expires when the child has forked something that inherited the process group — and
    # even then `run` returns instead of waiting.
    KILL_GRACE = 2.seconds

    # After the child is gone, how long the stdout/stderr pumps are given to hand over what
    # they read. Same reasoning as KILL_GRACE: a grandchild holding the write end open must
    # not become gori's problem.
    COLLECT_GRACE = 2.seconds
