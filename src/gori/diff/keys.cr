  # The endpoint identity the whole diff is keyed on: a host, a verb, and a path
  # TEMPLATE — `/users/{uuid}/orders`, not `/users/3f2a…/orders`.
  #
  # Identity is the crux of a retest diff. Two engagements never capture the same ids,
  # so a diff keyed on literal paths reports every row twice (once "removed", once
  # "added") and says nothing. The folding that fixes that already exists and is already
  # what the operator is looking at — `Sitemap`'s `fold_templates!` / `group_sequences!` /
  # `fold_queries!` passes — so this module reuses those rather than inventing a second
  # normalization. A key that disagreed with the Sitemap tab would make the diff and the
  # tab describe different endpoints (P3).

  # Folds the UNION of BOTH sides at once, deliberately. Every fold pass has a count
  # threshold (`SEQUENCE_GROUP_THRESHOLD`, `TEMPLATE_GROUP_THRESHOLD`), so folding each
  # side alone lets the SAME route fold on the side that happened to capture more ids and
  # stay literal on the other — which is precisely the added/removed noise the folding is
  # here to remove. One tree, one set of fold decisions, both sides keyed by it.
