module Gori
  # The ONE reading of a compile-time embedded list — `Discover::Wordlist`, `Miner::Wordlist`,
  # `Fuzz::Presets` (#1151). The curated `.txt` convention is one entry per line, surrounding
  # whitespace trimmed, blank and `#` lines skipped. It is the convention for gori's OWN assets
  # only: an operator's merge file is material, read with each caller's own fidelity rule (see
  # `merge_user_file` / `Presets.load`), and must never be routed through `parse`.
  #
  # `Env::USER_AGENTS` holds the same convention, but applies it in a macro so an empty corpus
  # fails the build — keep the two in step.
