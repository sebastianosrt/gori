  # Issue-linked retest (#1036): the smallest thing that turns a confirmed finding into a
  # REPRODUCIBLE check — an ordered list of Repeater sends, each with a role and at most one
  # assertion, plus a bounded record of what happened the last few times it ran.
  #
  # Entity links (`links.cr`) say what material is RELATED to an issue; frozen evidence
  # (`evidence.cr`) keeps the bytes that proved it. Neither can be RUN. The prose in an
  # issue's notes — "send #4 first to log in, then #5 should answer 403, and #6 is the
  # control" — is the thing a retest replaces, and prose is exactly what is lost when the
  # person who wrote it is not the person verifying the fix.
  #
  # Everything here is surface-independent and pure except `Engine`, which is handed a
  # `Backend`: the live one dials through `Repeater::Plan` under the project's scope gate,
  # a spec's returns canned observations. The three surfaces (TUI card, `gori run retest`,
  # MCP `run_retest`) share this module and differ only in how they ask and how they print.
