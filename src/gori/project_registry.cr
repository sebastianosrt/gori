    # display name is a non-ASCII phrase stored in `.name`, and `--project=a1b2` work as a
    # short handle decoupled from the (renamable) name.
    #
    # Order matters: the exact matches are tried before the id-prefix, so a hex-like
    # display name can never be shadowed by another project's id prefix. An ambiguous
    # prefix (2+ ids share it) resolves to nothing rather than guessing.
    #
    # Slug and display name are ONE tier, and a name they split between two projects raises
    # `Ambiguous` instead of picking (#1163). Trying the slug first meant `client-2024` —
    # the name `project create` had just reported creating (as slug `client-2024-2`) —
    # resolved to the older `Client 2024` whose slug it happened to be, and every
    # `--project client-2024` wrote into the other engagement's project. Preferring the
    # name instead is the same bug pointed the other way: a script that addressed
    # `Client 2024` by its slug would be silently re-aimed the moment someone created
    # `client-2024`. Refusing is the only answer that is never wrong, and both projects
    # stay reachable by the short id and slug the refusal names.

    # slugs `api` and `api-2`). When the slug match is ALSO one of the name matches, the
