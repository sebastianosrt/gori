  # Search the captured flows of MANY projects for one needle (#1229): "which engagement did I
  # see this token / host / endpoint in?". The project picker's `^F` is the surface; this is
  # the engine, so a CLI or MCP adapter can reuse it later without touching the TUI.
  #
  # THE CONSTRAINT everything below serves: a search must not write, migrate or lock any of
  # the databases it reads. That rules out `Store.open`, including `read_only: true` —
  # `Schema.migrate!` still migrates a STALE schema on that path, and a picker holding
  # hundreds of projects stamped at a dozen different versions would silently migrate every
  # one of them on the first keystroke, and refuse any written by a newer gori. So each
  # database is opened RAW and read-only through the C API, and the query touches only what
  # every schema version since V1 has: `flows_fts` and the `flows` core columns. A stale or a
  # newer schema is searched exactly like a current one.
  #
  # Raw, not through crystal-sqlite3, because the shard hardcodes `READWRITE | CREATE` into
  # `sqlite3_open_v2` and ignores a `mode=ro` URL parameter — and a read-WRITE connection is
  # the thing that writes: closing the LAST connection to a database checkpoints its WAL into
  # the db file (see `Store.project_census`, which has to put mtimes back afterwards for that
  # reason). A `SQLITE_OPEN_READONLY` connection never checkpoints. Measured on macOS and
  # Linux: against a live writer and against a crashed project's uncheckpointed WAL, neither
  # the db file nor the `-wal` moves by a byte or a nanosecond. See `open_mode` for the one
  # shape where READONLY alone is not enough.
  #
  # Cooperative (P6): one project at a time, `Fiber.yield` between them, and the query's
  # progress handler is a `Store::QueryControl`, so a caller on another fiber can cancel a
  # search mid-query and the picker keeps painting while it runs.
