  # The Discover engine: spiders a target (follows links a user never clicked) AND
  # brute-forces unlinked directories/paths, feeding every found endpoint back into the
  # Sitemap. Headless and self-contained — it depends only on the Repeater send engines
  # (via the reused Fuzz::Sender/Backend), the body decoder, and a caller-injected scope
  # closure; never on Store or the TUI. The one engine drives the TUI Discover sub-tab,
  # `gori run discover`, and the MCP discover_* tools.
  #
  # Correctness under adversarial/huge sites is the whole point: five independent bounds
  # (max_depth, max_pages, template saturation, content-cluster saturation, and the global
  # max_requests) keep a crawl from running away, and a per-directory soft-404 calibrator
  # keeps the brute-force false-positive rate down.
