  # The builder never writes the user-facing sentence: every surface phrases these in its
  # own idiom (`gori run discover: --target URL is required` vs the TUI's `start from
  # Sitemap/History (space → > D Discover here)`), and those strings are part of each
  # surface's contract. So `reason` is the machine-readable fact and the `message` here is
  # only a fallback for a caller that has nothing better to say.

  # A normalized, surface-independent description of ONE discover run.
  #
  # Each surface's remaining job is to parse ITS OWN input format into this — `OptionParser`
  # for `gori run discover`, the JSON args hash for MCP, the config overlay's state for the
  # TUI tab — and nothing else. Everything downstream of it (seed normalization, wordlist
  # load, scope policy, sender, engine, and the `Env.expand` / host-override wiring that used
  # to drift between the three copies) belongs to `Plan.build`.
  #
  # `config` is the live mutable object the caller owns — the TUI's discover config overlay
  # edits its `Config` in place while a run row is selected, so the plan must read that
  # instance, not a copy of it. The builder never writes to it (see the header expansion in
  # `Plan.build`): a re-run of the same row must see exactly what the operator configured.

    # so they happen exactly once, on every surface (see `Plan.build`).

    # Every knob of the run: pacing, budget, techniques, depth, containment, extensions,
    # custom headers, AND the user wordlist path (`config.user_wordlist`). One field, one
    # source — the TUI's overlay already stored the path there while `gori run --wordlist`
    # and MCP's `wordlist` arg used to pass it separately and leave the Config's copy nil.

    # that could not carry it, which made an IP-direct sweep of a name-based vhost
    # inexpressible (the crawler also owns its `Host:` header, so there was no second way in).
    #
    # Reached from `gori run discover --sni` and MCP `discover_start{sni}` ONLY. The Discover TAB
    # cannot set it — `DiscoverController#build_engine` passes neither this nor `http2`, and

    # views all carry `sni_override` + `@http2`. That is where the rollout stopped on purpose

    # said here because "Mirrors Fuzz/Miner/Sequencer" used to read as settled on all three.

  # The sequence *expand → scheme default → parse → wordlist → scope policy → sender →
  # engine* used to exist three times over (TUI `build_engine`, `gori run discover`, MCP
  # `build_discover_job`), and the copies had drifted: the TUI applied neither `Env.expand`
  # nor the project's host overrides and rejected a bare host outright, while MCP expanded
  # custom header values and `gori run discover` did not. One builder makes those answers the
  # same by construction.
  #
  # `outbound` is an ARGUMENT, never built here: Layer-1 strictness differs per surface on
  # purpose (`Outbound.agent` / `.cli` / `.interactive`, DESIGN.md §7), and constructing one
  # in here would silently collapse that distinction into whichever policy was hard-coded.
  # Discover is also the one tool whose *engine* carries a scope of its own (`ScopePolicy`,
  # which keeps the engine Store-free), and that policy is DERIVED from this same Outbound —
  # see `resolve_policy`.
