    # The class is `Codec::Http1.request_token_safe?`'s and is not restated here: every octet
    # <= 0x20 or 0x7F, because `Sender#build_get` writes `GET #{target} HTTP/1.1` and those
    # octets are unrepresentable in a request-line token. That predicate is the rule's one
    # home (#397); this method is the only thing Discover adds to it — a REPAIR for the half
    # of the class that has one.
    #
    # The two halves get different remedies because they do different things to the wire:
    #
    #   * CR and LF FRAME. They do not corrupt one request line, they end it and start a
    #     second message (#390). No author writes them into an `<a href>`, so they are left
    #     RAW here on purpose — `Headers.safe_url?` drops such a URL at every enqueue and
    #     `Sender#fetch` refuses it at the wire, which is the disposition #390 settled.
    #     Encoding them instead would turn a splice attempt into a real request for a URL
    #     nobody authored.
    #   * Everything else (SP, TAB, DEL, the remaining C0) SEPARATES fields. `<a href="/my
    #     file.pdf">` is ordinary handwritten HTML — a browser percent-encodes it and fetches
    #     the file — so refusing it would silently shrink a crawl's coverage, and a 400 from
    #     a strict origin diverges from the soft-404 baseline (`Calibrate.hit?` scores
    #     `status_div` at +0.50), making it a false-POSITIVE source too. It is repaired.
    #
    # Applied at PARSE rather than in `build_get`, because a URL must have exactly ONE
    # spelling: the same string feeds `visit_key`, `template_key`, the Layer-2 gate question,
    # the Finding, and the Sitemap row `Persist` writes. Encoding only at the wire would
    # leave the raw octet in all five — the gate would judge a different URL than the one
    # sent, and a byte-exact Repeater re-send of a stored finding would reproduce the
    # corruption. It also makes discover ask the gate the already-encoded form every other
    # Layer-2 consumer sees, since those targets arrive off the wire from a real client.
    #
    # Idempotent, which `#{bl.dir}#{cand}` and any re-crawled link rely on: `%` is not in the
