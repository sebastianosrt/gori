    # Layer 2, and therefore the line that owes DESIGN.md §7's "one reload semantic for the
    # active-traffic scope gate" (#354). Discover's Layer 2 runs through THIS object and not
    # through `Outbound#sweep_block`, because the engine is deliberately Store-free — which is
    # exactly why `Outbound#refresh` was never reached: `cli/run/discover.cr` and
    # `mcp/tools/discover.cr` both use their `Outbound` for `Plan.build` plus the up-front
    # Layer-1 guard, and then hand the engine a policy that never calls back into it. So
    # `gori run project scope add exclude string logout` in a second terminal stopped an
    # in-flight fuzz/mine/sequence within a second while an in-flight discover — potentially
    # thousands of probes — kept going against a start-time snapshot (#396). Only the TUI was
    # exempt, and by accident: it shares its live `Scope` object, which its own data_version
    # poll reloads.
    # `url` is the port-FREE spelling every url-level INCLUDE was written for (#407);
    # `exclude_url` is the same url WITH its port and is asked of the EXCLUDE side ONLY, and
    # only when there is a distinct one (a default port has none). Before it, an
    # `exclude string ":8443"` held on the proxy and not here, so one scope described two
    # different sets depending on which tool was asking (#884). The sandbox test stays on the
    # port-free url: it is `sandbox && !allowlisted?`, and the allowlist is the include side.

    # Layer 1, and SNAPSHOT at construction on purpose — the one thing the #396 reload must
    # not make mutable.
    #
    # This answers "does a scope exist to bound the crawl", which is what switches
    # `Containment::ScopeAware` between the same-origin fallback and `boundary?`. Delegating
    # it live would let the reload rewrite the containment mode mid-run, and the direction it
    # rewrites in is catastrophic: on a project with NO rules, an operator adding the single
    # canonical `exclude string logout` flips `configured?` false→true, and `matches_url?`
    # requires at least one INCLUDE (`Scope#allowlisted_unlocked?` — an excludes-only scope is
    # deliberately not an allowed range), so `boundary?` becomes false for EVERY url. The
    # operator asked to skip one path and the whole crawl would stop, silently.
    #
    # DESIGN.md §3 and the #354 entry already draw this line: Layer 1's strictness is settled
    # per surface before the first byte, Layer 2 is the layer that is identical everywhere and
    # applied continuously. #396 asked for the second, not the first.

    # blocking reload so a burst of concurrent worker fibers cannot stampede the store (the
    # check-then-set is a non-yielding critical section on the single-threaded scheduler); and

  # operator explicitly named). Without this, StoreScope#boundary? blocked every hop the
  # seed's own include rules don't match — so --allow-unscoped fetched only the seed +
