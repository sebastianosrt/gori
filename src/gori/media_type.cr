  # The `Content-Type` of a message head, and the questions every body decoder asks of it.
  #
  # Five surfaces had grown their own copy of this scan — `Graphql`, `FormData`, `Pretty`,
  # `Mcp::Serialize` and `CLI::Run::History` — and they did not agree: two matched the header
  # name by taking the first 13 bytes (so `Content-Type:x` with no space still worked but a
  # leading space did not), three compared the pre-colon token case-insensitively, and only
  # some stopped at the blank line that ends the head. A decoder that reads the content type
  # differently from the decoder next to it is exactly how a body ends up parsed on one
  # surface and shown as an ordinary request on another, which is the whole failure this
  # module exists to remove. One scan, one spelling of "is this JSON", one place to fix.
  #
  # Parsing is deliberately lenient in the way HTTP is: the media TYPE is case-insensitive and
  # is folded, a PARAMETER value is not (a multipart `boundary=----X` and `boundary=----x`
  # delimit different bodies) so `of` hands back the original spelling and only `essence`
  # folds.

    # The `Content-Type` header VALUE — media type plus parameters, original case — or nil
    # when the head carries none. `scrub`bed: a head is read straight off the wire and a
    # hostile one is not guaranteed to be valid UTF-8.
    #
    # Two paths, one answer. `insert_one` reads this for EVERY captured flow on the Store
    # writer fiber, and the `String` scan below copied the whole head, scrubbed it and built a
    # `String` per line to find one header (4.9µs / 2.2 KB on a 14-header POST). A pure-ASCII
    # head — every real one — is walked as bytes instead (`AsciiBytes.each_head_field`, the
    # same line/chomp/colon/strip rules), allocating only the returned value. Any byte ≥ 0x80
    # takes the `String` scan verbatim, since `scrub`, Unicode `strip` and Unicode case
    # folding only differ there. `spec/media_type_spec.cr` holds the two to one answer.

    # spellings that carry ordinary JSON without the suffix: AWS's `application/x-amz-json-1.1`,
    # `application/x-ndjson`, anything with `json` in the subtype. A substring match, because
    # the readers this gates (Pretty's pretty-print, the Highlighter's colouring, the
    # Minimizer's key extraction) all `JSON.parse` and fall back to raw on failure — so a false

    # dropped every `x-amz-json` body) loses the feature on a whole class of real API traffic.

    # This is NOT the axis `Graphql.from_body` dispatches on: THAT needs `essence` and an
    # EXACT match, because `application/graphql` (a raw document) is a prefix of
