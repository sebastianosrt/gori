module Gori
  # A session slot re-authenticating itself (#1233): replay the Repeater sessions in the
  # slot's `refresh` list, in order, and let the slot's own extract rules rebind it.
  #
  # Almost everything this needs already existed. Extract rules watch Repeater responses and
  # rebind `$BIND.NAME` per slot (`Bindings#observe`), bindings resolve PER SEND rather than at
  # plan-build (`Fuzz::Sender#send`), and a multi-step login already chains — step 1's response
  # rebinds `$BIND.CSRF` and step 2 carries it. What was missing is the actor that sends the
  # login request. That is all this is.
  #
  # ## Two triggers, and not a third
  #
  #   * **Manual** — `refresh`: the TUI picker's ^R, `gori run session refresh`, MCP
  #     `refresh_session_slot`.
  #   * **Before send** — `before_send`: every gori-originated send seam asks, for the slot it
  #     goes out as, and a slot whose `refresh_before` policy says its token is about to expire
  #     is refreshed first.
  #
  # Retry-after-failure (refresh on a 401, then re-send) is deliberately NOT here, because it
  # produces wrong answers rather than just complexity: in Authorize a 401 IS the result, in a
  # Fuzz run one row would stand for two requests, and a refresh that itself 401s needs loop
  # protection against locking the account. Acting BEFORE a send never reinterprets a response.
  #
  # ## What a step is
  #
  # A saved Repeater session, sent the way `Retest::LiveBackend` sends one: the same
  # `Repeater::Plan`, the same draft-marker refusal, the surface's own Layer-1 scope check and
  # Layer-2 gate, and one History row per send (source `refresh`). Sent AS the slot without
  # activating it (`PlanOptions#refresh_slot`): its `$BIND.*` read this slot's table, its
  # response rebinds this slot, and no header overlay is written — the login request must not
  # carry the stale credential it is replacing.
  #
  # ## Failure policy
  #
  # A failed refresh never blocks the send that asked for it: the send continues with the
  # value it has, and the failure is surfaced (an `events` row, the outcome queue a TUI drains
  # for its toast). An AUTOMATIC refresh that failed is not retried for `COOLDOWN`, and after
  # `FAILURE_LIMIT` consecutive failures automatic refresh turns OFF for that slot until a
  # manual refresh succeeds — a login endpoint hammered once per fuzz request is an account
  # lockout with a progress bar.
  #
  # ## Per process
  #
  # Binding values are memory-only by design, so each process (TUI, `gori mcp`, `gori run`)
  # refreshes its OWN table. A refresh in the TUI does not update a running `gori mcp`. The
  # state below — last outcome, failure count, cooldown — is per process for the same reason.
