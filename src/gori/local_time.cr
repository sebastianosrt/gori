module Gori
  # RFC 3339 UTC at millisecond precision from unix micros (the store's `created_at` unit) —
  # the `*_iso` spelling every gori surface emits, MCP, `gori run` and the diff report alike.
  # The Span addition RAISES `ArgumentError` on an instant past year 9999 (a hand-edited or
  # foreign column, or an import whose source dated an entry there), which used to cost the
  # caller its whole document for one row (a truncated `--format json`, an MCP `-32603`);
  # such an instant reads as the module-wide dash.
  def self.iso_micros(micros : Int64) : String
    sec, micro = micros.divmod(1_000_000)
    (Time.utc(1970, 1, 1) + sec.seconds + micro.microseconds).to_s("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%LZ")

  # Rendering a STORED instant in the operator's timezone, without letting the timezone decide
  # whether the row can be displayed at all.
  #
  # `Time#to_local` RAISES `ArgumentError: Invalid time: seconds out of range` when the instant
  # plus the local utc offset lands past `Time::MAX` — so an instant near the far end of the
  # range renders in `TZ=UTC` and `TZ=America/New_York` and raises in `TZ=Asia/Seoul` and
  # `TZ=Europe/Berlin`. The data half is just as ordinary: a HAR entry dated
  # `9999-12-31T23:59:59.999Z` imports without complaint, and `Time.unix` itself refuses a
  # `created_at` column far past that (a hand-edited or foreign database).
  #
  # That made a stored row able to end a session. Eight call sites read `created_at` micros
  # straight into `Time.unix(...).to_local.to_s(...)`, seven of them on TUI render paths, where
  # the same frame is asked for again 50ms later: three failures trip the Runner's tick breaker
  # and the process ends. The eighth is a QL `date:` filter, which raises while FILTERING — the
  # row does not even have to be drawn.
  #
  # The fallback is UTC rather than an error, because the question the cell answers ("when did
  # this happen") still has an answer; only the operator's preferred spelling of it does not.
  # A `%:z` format therefore shows `+00:00` on exactly the rows that could not be localised,
  # which is the honest reading, and every other row is unaffected.
