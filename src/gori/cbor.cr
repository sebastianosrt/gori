module Gori
  # Schema-less CBOR (RFC 8949) reader. A pure byte parser over a `Bytes` slice
  # (no I/O) that renders a captured body as JSON text. Sibling of the protobuf
  # decoder in `src/gori/protobuf.cr`: same job — make an opaque binary body
  # readable without a schema — and the same refusal to guess.
  #
  # CBOR is self-describing, so unlike protobuf there is no ambiguity to report:
  # every item says what it is. The problem moves to the other end. CBOR carries
  # types JSON does not have (byte strings, non-string map keys, tags, undefined,
  # NaN, integers past 2^63) and the tempting move — coerce them into the nearest
  # JSON shape — is the failure class this reader is written to avoid. Every such
  # item gets an explicit `$`-prefixed envelope instead, so a reader can always
  # tell "the body said this" from "JSON could not say that". The envelopes are
  # `$bin`, `$str_invalid_utf8`, `$tag`, `$bignum`, `$bignum_omitted`, `$time`,
  # `$undefined`, `$simple`, `$float`, `$non_string_keys` and `$partial`. The
  # same rule covers a reading this reader DECLINED to make: `$bignum_omitted`
  # names it rather than leaving a bignum indistinguishable from a tag nobody
  # looked at. A CBOR text key spelled the same way as one of these envelopes is
  # indistinguishable from a marker in the output; that
  # collision is accepted, because the alternative (escaping every key) makes the
  # common body unreadable to buy safety in a body nobody sends.
  #
  # Never raises on hostile / truncated input (P7): the parse stops where the
  # bytes stop, the JSON built so far is returned, and `complete` is false.
  # Recursion, item counts and every length claim are bounded.

    # Nesting ceiling. Hostile input is the normal case for a proxy; `81 81 81 …`
    # is three bytes per level, so a crafted body reaches thousands of levels in
    # a few KB and must not blow the fiber stack.
    MAX_DEPTH = 32

    # Total item ceiling for one body, not per container: the cheap bomb is a
    # flat `9f 00 00 00 … ff`, one byte per item, which a per-container limit
    # would wave through. Far above any realistic body.
    MAX_ITEMS = 100_000

    # Bignum (tag 2/3) byte-string ceiling for the decimal rendering. Base-256 to
    # base-10 is quadratic in the digit count, so an unbounded bignum is a CPU
    # bomb with a 9-byte header. 512 bytes covers an RSA-4096 modulus, which is
    # the realistic reason a security tool cares. Past it the raw bytes are still
    # emitted — only the decimal spelling is dropped, and `$bignum_omitted` says so.
    MAX_BIGNUM_BYTES = 512

    # Total bignum-decimal WORK for ONE document. The cap above bounds one bignum and nothing
    # bounds how many there are, which is the whole gap: the same 1 MiB body — the size
    # `Pretty::MAX_PRETTY` already hands to this reader — costs 2.2 ms as plain byte strings
    # and 770 ms as ~2 000 maximum-size bignums, 350× more, because the conversion is quadratic
    # per bignum and linear in their number. That is a blocking freeze on the TUI detail path,
    # which rebuilds on every selection of that flow and on every theme or `p` toggle, and the
    # ceiling on the same shape at `MAX_JSON_BYTES` was ~1.65 s.
    #
    # Charged as n², which is what the conversion actually costs, so the handful of small
    # bignums a real document carries are free and only the bomb pays: the budget is sixteen
    # maximum-size bignums, or any number of small ones summing to the same work.
    MAX_BIGNUM_WORK = 16_i64 * MAX_BIGNUM_BYTES * MAX_BIGNUM_BYTES

    # Output ceiling for ONE document. The four above bound the INPUT walk and the work it
    # costs, and none of them bounds the OUTPUT — which is not a function of the input's size
    # here.
    #
    # A non-string map KEY is rendered as its own JSON text and that text becomes the member
    # name (see `map_item`), so a map keyed on a MAP nests the inner rendering inside a JSON
    # string once per level — and each level's escaping roughly doubles it. `a1 a1 a1 …`, one
    # byte per level, therefore grows the output as 2^depth: 26 bytes produced 536 MB, and 28
    # bytes reached the point where `String::Builder` refuses to grow and raised `IO::EOFError`
    # straight out of `render` — the one thing this module promises never to do. (Those two
    # spellings ran OUT of input; `pair` no longer nests a key that failed, so the shape that
    # still reaches here is one whose keys all terminate — `a1` × 22 then `f6` × 23, 45 bytes,
    # which rendered 16.7 MB. The ceiling is the same and so is the reason.) `MAX_DEPTH`
    # cannot fix it (the blow-up is well inside 32 levels) and a per-key length cap cannot
    # either (`MAX_ITEMS` keys at any cap is still that cap × 100 000).
    #
    # Charged across the whole document, scratch key renders included, so it bounds the WORK
