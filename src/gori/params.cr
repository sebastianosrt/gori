  # Every named INPUT a captured request carries — query, urlencoded form, multipart, JSON,
  # header and cookie — as a flat (location, name, value) stream. The read behind the
  # parameter inventory (`ParamInventory`, #1231), and deliberately a READ: nothing here is
  # ever spliced back onto the wire.
  #
  # Not a lift of `Probe::Active::InsertionPoints.enumerate` or `Miner::Inject.existing_names`,
  # although both walk the same surfaces. Each is shaped by the injector it serves, and
  # widening either would break the invariant it exists for: InsertionPoints yields only
  # TOP-LEVEL JSON strings (the members `build` can splice) with `index`/`raw_*` addressing
  # that the per-rule `dedup_key` equivalence pins, and `existing_names`' JSON set is on purpose
  # the same capped BFS `inject_json_nodes` writes into. An inventory needs the opposite of
  # both — every leaf at every depth, with its value — so it has its own walk, built on the
  # same primitives rather than a re-derivation of them:
  #
  #   * query / form / multipart → `FormData.from_flow`, the PARAMS pane's projection (it
  #     already reads the ENTITY, so a chunked or gzip'd form is not listed as garbage);
  #   * JSON → one pull-parser walk over `Entity.bytes`, gated by `MediaType.json?`, reading
  #     numbers as their TEXT (never converted, so a value past Int64 cannot raise);
  #   * headers / cookies → `Miner::Inject.each_ascii_line`, the byte-safe head walk.
  #
  # Values are DECODED and UNSCRUBBED — captured bytes may be invalid UTF-8, and a surface
  # scrubs at the point it prints (P7: the octets stay canonical here).
