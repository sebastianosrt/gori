  # The Scope lens (DESIGN.md §3): an include/exclude rule set that decides which
  # flows are "interesting". It's primarily a DISPLAY filter — everything is captured,
  # but History/Sitemap show only in-scope flows when active — and it ALSO gates
  # intercept holding. Owned by the TUI (Runner), persisted per project.
  #
  # Each rule has a KIND (include/exclude) and a MATCH_TYPE:
  #   host   — match the host: exact, subdomain (`acme.test` ⊇ `api.acme.test`), or
  #            a `*` glob (`*.acme.test`). Case-insensitive.
  #   string — case-insensitive substring of the full URL `scheme://host/target`.
  #   regex  — regex over the full URL `scheme://host/target`. Case-SENSITIVE (use an
  #            inline `(?i)` flag to opt out) so it matches the SQL `REGEXP` exactly.
  #
  # Evaluation (Burp-style): in scope ⇔ (NO include rules OR a rule matches an include)
  # AND (no exclude rule matches). So excludes-only ⇒ everything except the excludes.

    #
    #   · non-ASCII — SQLite's built-in `lower()` folds ASCII only while Crystal's
    #     `String#downcase` folds all of Unicode, so a rule `äcme.test` matched a captured
    #     `ÄCME.test` in the live gate and nothing in History.
    #   · `{a,b}` — Crystal's `File.match?` reads brace alternation; SQLite's GLOB reads the
    #     braces literally. An include `*.acme.{test,dev}` matched three hosts live and none
    #     in History, and an exclude with braces carved out nothing in SQL — fail-OPEN on the
    #     display lens, the direction that matters.
    #   · a SURROUNDING bracket pair — `HostPattern::Compiled` peels it for the exact/subdomain
    #     arm (`@bare`) but globs against the UN-peeled `@down`, so `[2001:db8::*]` is a rule
    #     that matches NOTHING in Crystal (`File.match?` reads the outer `[…]` as a character
    #     class). host_cond peels first, so its GLOB would match every host under
    #     `2001:db8::` — a dead INCLUDE listing its flows as in-scope in History while
    #     `allowlisted_unlocked?` refuses every request, i.e. Sandbox black-holes the proxy
    #     with `include_count` non-zero and the "blocks everything" warning quiet. Gated on
    #     the bracket pair alone rather than "bracketed AND globbed": which of Compiled's two
    #     arms applies is exactly the thing not worth restating here.

    # stays native (host matching runs per row of every scope-filtered reload) and the shapes
    # it cannot spell have no second dialect at all. `?`, a non-surrounding `[…]` and an
    # unbalanced `[` were checked and agree between the two engines; `/ \ ? # @` and whitespace

    # a non-TLS site, a hand-written `send_request` `raw` template, …). Concatenating
    # scheme://host onto an already-absolute target doubles it into
    # `http://hosthttp://host/path`, which silently breaks any anchored or exact-match
    # string/regex scope rule for such requests (unanchored patterns still match — the
    # real target survives as a suffix — which is how this went unnoticed). Shared by
    # every caller that builds this URL from a live request's parts (Interceptor,
    # send_request); the absolute-form check itself is Store::FlowRow.absolute_form?
    # (models.cr), also used by QL::URL_EXPR below, so a case-sensitivity fix only
    # needs to land in one place. Deliberately does NOT add the port the way FlowRow#url
    # does, so an origin-form target still builds the exact same URL every existing
    # Scope spec already agrees on.
