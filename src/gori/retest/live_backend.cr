    # The `Backend` that actually dials — one step, one send, through the same
    # `Repeater::Plan` every other hand-authored send goes through, under the project's two
    # scope layers.
    #
    # ## Why this reuses `Repeater::Plan` rather than `Fuzz::Sender`
    #
    # A retest step IS a Repeater session replayed, and the differences are load-bearing.
    # `Repeater::Sender` resolves declared session bindings at the send seam and OBSERVES the
    # response through the project's extract rules (`Bindings#observe`) — which is what makes
    # `setup` → `variant` mean anything at all: the login step mints `$SESSION` and the next
    # step's `Authorization: Bearer $SESSION` picks it up. `Fuzz::Sender` deliberately does
    # not observe, for the reason its own comment gives (a sweep must not rebind a session to
    # a payload-derived value), and a retest is a small ordered sequence of deliberate sends,
    # not a sweep.
    #
    # ## Why the tab's stored response is left alone
    #
    # `gori run repeater send` persists a successful response back onto the `repeaters` row.
    # This does NOT, and the reason is the one `Evidence` is built around: a Repeater tab
    # holds exactly one response and the next send replaces it. A retest sends every step on
    # every run, so persisting would destroy the response that proved the finding the first
    # time this issue was filed — and it would keep only the LAST run's answer, so a result
    # row from two runs ago would open a response it never produced.
    #
    # Instead every send is recorded in History with `source: retest` and a `source_ref`
    # naming the issue and the step, and the result row keeps that `flow_id`. That is what
    # the issue's "preserve each individual send in History with clear provenance" asks for,
    # and it is what lets an old result row still open the exact response it reported.
    class LiveBackend < Backend
      # Per-step connect + idle ceiling. A retest is a short ordered sequence an operator (or
      # CI) is waiting on, so it is tighter than an interactive Repeater send and matches
