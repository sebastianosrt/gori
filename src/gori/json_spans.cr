module Gori
  # WHERE things are in a JSON document, as byte offsets into the bytes it arrived as — so a
  # caller can splice into those bytes instead of re-serializing them.
  #
  # `JSON.parse(..).to_json` is not a no-op on a captured body, and for an injector that has to
  # keep "everything else byte-exact" every difference is a different request (#1183):
  #
  #   - a duplicated member (`{"dup":"first","dup":"second"}`, the parser-differential probe) is
  #     folded to its last value, so a first-wins target stops seeing the value it was sent;
  #   - numbers are converted (`1.0e2` → `100.0`), and one past Int64/Float64 raises outright;
  #   - string escapes (`\u00e9`, `\/`) and all whitespace are re-spelled.
  #
  # `RawJson` keeps members and numbers too, but through the pull parser, which reports
  # values and not their offsets — so it can re-emit a document, not edit one in place.
  #
  # Validity is decided by the stdlib lexer (`JSON::PullParser#skip`, which checks syntax
  # without converting numbers), so this accepts exactly what `JSON.parse` does minus the
  # number-range failures; the walk after it only has to find structure in bytes already known
  # to be one JSON value. Byte-wise throughout: a string value may carry bytes that are not
  # valid UTF-8, and they are never touched.
