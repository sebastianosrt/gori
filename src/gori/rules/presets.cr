module Gori
  # A static catalog of response-modification presets for the Rewriter (#821). Each preset is
  # the Burp-style one-click option every tester writes by hand every engagement — unhide
  # hidden fields, enable disabled controls, strip length limits and validation, drop CSP and
  # security headers, disable SRI — expressed as ordinary `Store::MatchRule` shapes.
  #
  # A preset is a STARTING POINT, not a capability: gori's Match&Replace already expresses all
  # of these. Installing a preset writes plain, visible, editable, disable-able rules through
  # the same rule-write path as manual authoring (P1) — nothing hidden, nothing magic (P4).
  # Once installed they are indistinguishable from a rule the operator typed, and can be
  # edited, toggled, moved or deleted like any other.
  #
  # This is a static catalog, not a templating engine (P0): the specs are literal below, and
  # the only work at install time is looping `RuleSpec` rows into `insert_rule` /
  # `Settings.add_rewriter_rule`. Every surface (TUI picker, `gori run rewriter preset`, the
  # MCP `create_rule_from_preset`) reads THIS list, so a preset means the identical rule set
  # everywhere.
  #
  # The catalog holds ONLY `Replace` (literal/regex) and `RemoveHeader` rules. It never emits a
  # `Pipe` op: a `Pipe` runs an external command (`Gori::ProcessHook`), so a preset that
  # installed one would be gori running a command the operator never wrote (#818). The
  # regex-over-markup rules accept the known limits of that approach — a `disabled` inside a
  # quoted attribute value is stripped too — and stay conservative rather than reaching for a
  # DOM parser (out of scope). All patterns compile through the proxy's `Store::SafeRegexp`
  # like every other rule.
  module RulePresets
    # One rule a preset installs. The fields line up with `insert_rule` / `Rules#add` exactly,
    # so a surface can splat a spec straight into either. `name` is the RULE's label (not the
    # preset's) — carried so an installed rule says which preset it came from and is findable
    # in the list, which is what makes "added twice" visible and deletable rather than silent.
    #
    # A `Replace` body rule's `replacement` uses Crystal's native `\1`/`\2` backreferences, not
    # the Caido-style `$1`: the `$`→`\` translation only runs when the operator's configured
    # env prefix appears in the string, so a literal `\1` is the spelling that holds whatever
    # the prefix is set to.
