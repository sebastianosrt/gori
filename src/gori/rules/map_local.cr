    # Map-local (#1237): a `respond: dir` short-circuit rule serves the file the request path
    # names from a local directory.
    #
    # The request target is the CLIENT's bytes. P7 keeps them verbatim on the wire and in History,
    # but here they would name a LOCAL FILE — a new sink — so the lookup is confined, and every
    # step below exists for that:
    #
    #   1. The path must be origin-form (`/…`), or the rule does not claim the request at all.
    #      The query and fragment are dropped, and `strip_prefix` is compared on the RAW bytes.
    #   2. Every `%` must introduce two hex digits: `URI.decode` passes a malformed escape
    #      through as text rather than refusing it. Then it decodes ONCE — `%252e` stays the
    #      literal name `%2e` — and not as a form, so `+` stays `+`.
    #   3. After decoding, a NUL, a `\` or any segment that STARTS WITH `.` is refused. That
    #      covers `.` and `..` however they were spelled (`%2e%2e`, `..%2f`), and also `.git`
    #      and `.env`: a mapped project directory must not hand its dotfiles to page script.
    #      This runs BEFORE any filesystem call, because `File.realpath` does not check for NUL
    #      and `File.info` raises on one.
    #   4. The candidate's `File.realpath` must sit under the root's. That is what stops a
    #      symlink inside the directory from pointing out of it.
    #
    # A refusal is never a fall-through: the rule claimed the request, so gori answers it (a
    # 404 marked `X-Gori-Short-Circuit: error`). Only a file that is simply ABSENT may fall
    # through, and only when the rule opted in.
    #
    # Out of scope, and documented rather than defended: someone who can WRITE to the mapped
    # directory can already change what it serves, so swapping a path component for a symlink
    # between the realpath and the read gains them nothing they did not have.
