  # The canned response half of a short-circuit rule (#511).
  #
  # A `ShortCircuit` rule carries its response in the same `replacement` field the other ops
  # use, authored as a raw HTTP response:
  #
  #     200 OK
  #     Content-Type: application/json
  #
  #     {"isAdmin": true}
  #
  # The first line is the status line (`200`, `200 OK` and `HTTP/1.1 200 OK` are all accepted;
  # the reason defaults to the registered phrase). Lines up to the first blank line are
  # headers. Everything after it is the inline body, kept byte-for-byte as typed — a stub is
  # the operator's bytes, so nothing is normalised into it (P7). When the rule names a
  # `body_file`, that file's bytes are the body instead and the inline body is ignored; that
  # is what makes a large or binary stub practical.
  #
  # `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` are DROPPED here, never trusted: ClientConn
  # re-derives the framing from the bytes it actually sends. A stub that declares a length it
  # doesn't have would desync the next request on a keep-alive connection.
  module RuleStub
    # Ceiling on a `body_file`. A stub body is held whole in memory (it has to be — the length
    # has to be known before the head is written), and this is a proxy hot path, so a rule

    # rule (#1237) serves a whole directory — a page's worth of scripts and styles — so the
    # count is sized for that, and `MAX_CACHED_BYTES` is what actually bounds the memory.
    MAX_CACHED_FILES = 256

    # keeps 256 of them from adding up to 2 GiB.
