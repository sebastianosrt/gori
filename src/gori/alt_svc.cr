  # `Alt-Svc` (RFC 7838), and gori's one answer to the HTTP/3 advertisement inside it.
  #
  # gori does not intercept HTTP/3. QUIC is UDP and every listener gori has is a TCP socket,
  # so an origin answering `Alt-Svc: h3=":443"` is inviting the client onto a transport
  # nothing here can read — and what the operator sees afterwards is a target that quietly
  # stopped talking. "I found nothing" and "I could not see it" read identically in an empty
  # History, which is why this header gets a switch (`Settings.strip_alt_svc?`) and not only
  # the warning `Probe::Analyzer` already emits.
  #
  # ONE HOME for the parse. The probe rule REPORTS the advertisement and the proxy REMOVES
  # it; if those two ever disagreed about what "advertises h3" means, a flow would be flagged
  # for a header gori had already taken off the wire, or — worse — stripped without anything
  # saying so. The predicate lived in `Probe::Passive::Tech` first and moved here the moment
  # the proxy became its second caller, which is the rule `request_token_safe?` had to learn
  # three times (#390, #394, #397).

    # The first `h3` / `h3-*` alternative in an `Alt-Svc` field-value, as evidence text, or
    # nil when the value advertises no HTTP/3 at all.
    #
    # RFC 7838 §3: the value is a comma-separated list of `protocol-id=authority` entries with
    # optional `;`-parameters. Three things this deliberately does NOT match:
    #
    #   * `clear` — RFC 7838 §3, "forget every alternative you have cached for me". That is
    #     the OPPOSITE of an invitation, and the one spelling of this header gori most wants
    #     delivered to the client.
    #   * `h2=…` — an alternative reached over TCP, so still a CONNECT through gori.
    #   * `fooh3=…` / `h32=…` — the protocol-id is the WHOLE token before `=`, never a
    #     substring, or a strip would eat a field it does not understand.
    #   * a comma INSIDE a quoted-string — see `each_alternative`. `alt-authority` is a
    #     quoted-string by grammar (§3) and a parameter's value may be one too, so an
    #     origin writing `fake=":443"; p="a, h3=x"` advertises no HTTP/3 whatever: a plain
    #     `split(',')` cut that field in two and read `h3=x"` out of the second half, which
    #     removed a header gori does not understand while claiming it had removed an h3
    #     advertisement (P7 — the strip must eat only fields it can name).

    # the next octet. Both the `alt-authority` and a parameter value can be one, so a comma
    # inside quotes belongs to the entry, not between two of them.

    # An UNBALANCED quote runs to the end of the value and yields one entry. That errs towards
