module Gori::Repeater
  # HTTP/2 connection reuse for a sweep's sends — the h2 half of what `ConnPool` does for
  # HTTP/1.1.
  #
  # ## Why this exists
  #
  # `H2Engine.send` dialed a connection, wrote the preface, exchanged ONE request on stream 1
  # and closed. Correct for the Repeater, where a send is an operator's deliberate act, and
  # ruinous for a sweep: an h2 origin is https by definition in practice, so every payload
  # paid a TCP handshake plus a full TLS handshake plus the h2 preface/SETTINGS round before
  # a single byte of it moved. `ConnPool` fixed exactly that for h1 and h2 was excluded from
  # it by one clause in `Fuzz::Sender` — while the seed path (`gori run fuzz`'s
  # `http2 = force_h2 || seed.http2`, and the TUI's ⇧I) turns h2 ON automatically for any
  # sweep of a captured h2 flow, which is most captured traffic from a modern target. So the
  # default workflow against the commonest kind of origin was the one paying per-request
  # handshakes. Measured on loopback for the h1 pool, where RTT is ~0 and the win is therefore
  # UNDERSTATED: 2000 https requests went 1.65s → 0.087s, 2000 handshakes → 50.
  #
  # ## One request at a time, not multiplexing
  #
  # A `Conn` here carries requests SERIALLY: stream 1, then 3, then 5. It is not an h2
  # multiplexer, and the distinction is the whole risk profile. Multiplexing means several
  # streams in flight on one socket, which needs a demultiplexing reader fiber, per-stream
  # queues, and a stream-state machine — a different program. Serial reuse needs none of that
  # and still collects the entire handshake win, because the handshake is what a sweep was
  # paying per request. Concurrency comes from holding SEVERAL connections, exactly as the h1
  # pool gets it from several sockets: `idle_conns` is the run's concurrency, so at most one
  # request is ever inside a given `Conn`.
  #
  # ## Reuse discipline
  #
  # Mirrors `ConnPool`'s, and for the same reason: gori points deliberately odd requests at
  # targets, so a connection is reused only when nothing about the last exchange makes the
  # next one ambiguous. `H2Engine::Conn#poisoned?` is where that verdict is recorded — GOAWAY,
  # RST_STREAM, a clean EOF, a stalled request body, a read that timed out, a response gori
  # could not frame to its end, or stream ids used up. On top of it this pool refuses to park
  # a connection whose Result carries an error or an incomplete body, and it never pools a
  # CONNECT (an h2 CONNECT is a tunnel, not a request).
  #
  # A parked connection the origin closed while it sat idle is normal, and it is discovered at
  # the same two moments `ConnPool` names, with the same consequences: at CHECKOUT, before a
  # byte is written, the redial is a FIRST send for any method; DURING the exchange it is
  # ambiguous, so only an idempotent request is replayed and anything else comes back as the
  # honest error it got. `STALE_GIVE_UP` consecutive stale checkouts and the pool stops
  # pooling for the rest of the run.
  #
  # Concurrency: the scheduler is single-threaded and neither the idle array's `pop`/`push`
  # nor the counter bumps yield, so a worker fiber can never observe a half-updated pool —
  # the same argument `ConnPool` makes.
  class H2Pool < Pool
    # As `ConnPool::STALE_GIVE_UP`: an origin that closes every parked connection turns each
    # park into a wasted probe and a redial, so after this many consecutive stale checkouts
    # the pool runs in dial-per-send mode for the rest of the run.
