      # the tool result still reported the stored target.

      # yet (#501) — and it is gone. `$NAME` without a value is a literal string on the wire
      # now, at every seam that interprets it, because the token grammar is byte-identical to
      # GraphQL's `$id`, Mongo's `$ne` and JSON Schema's `$ref`: declaring an extract rule
      # named `id` made every captured GraphQL body in the project unsendable. See

      # must read the REQUEST LINE THAT WILL GO OUT. Expanding for the verdict and sending the
      # token would ask the scope about `/api?SECRETTOKEN123=1` and then put `/api?$TOKEN=1` on

      # URL that never existed. Whichever way the pass is switched, both halves move together.

      # SCOPED TO THIS GATE, which is Layer 2 (Sandbox/exclude). LAYER 1 — MCP's
      # `request_scope_url` and the CLI's `repeater_scope_verdict` — still builds its URL from
      # `Plan#bytes`, the PRE-seam draft, so on a send that DOES expand the two layers are

      #
      # DRAFT bytes: predict the seam, then ask. `wire` is what will actually run, so the

      # Two passes, in this order:
      #
      #   * the `$NAME` binding pass, skipped when `resolve_bindings?` says so — for
      #     `evidence?` (somebody else wrote these bytes) or for `expand_bindings?` (the
      #     operator said these bytes ARE the message). See both.
      #   * the SESSION SLOT overlay, after the `$NAME` pass and regardless of EITHER of them.
      #     AFTER, because the slot's own header values may name a binding
      #     (`Authorization: Bearer $SESSION`) and the layer resolves those as it applies
      #     them, against the ACTIVE slot's table — so the order is "resolve the message,
      #     then write this identity over it", never the reverse. REGARDLESS, because a slot
      #     is not a resolution of somebody's tokens; it is the operator answering "send this
      #     AS WHOM" (P4), and replaying a capture under another identity is the single most
      #     common reason to ask. The no-overlay answer has a name and it is `as-captured` —
      #     select it, or select no slot at all, and this is the identity function.
      #
      #     `verbatim` does not change that answer, and the answer is STATED rather than
      #     inherited because the two flags arrived one round apart. `--verbatim` says which
      #     BYTES; a slot says WHOSE identity. They are different questions asked by the same
      #     operator in the same command (`gori run repeater send --slot admin --verbatim`),
      #     and letting the byte answer veto the identity one would send that command as the
      #     STORED identity while the operator named another — a silent substitution in the
      #     one direction P4 refuses. The `$NAME` in a slot header is also the one `$NAME` in
      #     gori that is guaranteed to be a reference and never a payload (`unbound_in_slot`
      #     argues it), so resolving it takes nothing literal away from the operator's bytes:
      #     the overlay writes the slot's own line, and every byte the operator typed that
      #     survives it is untouched.
      #
      # Header-only overlay, so Content-Length cannot move and the body stays byte-exact (P7).
      #
      # PUBLIC, and that is the point. These two passes ran INSIDE `send`, where no caller
      # could see their output — so every surface that RECORDS or REPORTS "the outbound
      # request" described the pre-seam draft: `gori run repeater send --record-history` and
      # MCP `send_request{record_history}` wrote a History flow with the slot's
      # `Authorization` line missing (and `$SESSION` still literal in it) while the socket
      # got both, and MCP's `effective_request` — documented as "the request actually put on
      # the wire" — was derived from the same pre-seam bytes. A flow recorded that way is not
      # the request that was sent: replay it, fuzz from it, or scan it and the identity gori
      # actually used is nowhere in the evidence. A caller now takes these bytes once, hands
      # them to `send_wire`, and records exactly what went out.
      #
      # The Fuzzer reaches the same seam through `Fuzz::Sender#send`, which runs the two passes
      # itself; its answer travels back on `Repeater::Result#wire` because a fuzz ROW must keep
