      # for `Env.expand_bindings` at the send seam." THIS is that seam, and it ran
      # unconditionally — so an extract rule declaring an ordinary name (`filter`, `top`,
      # `token`, `user`, `where`) rewrote a captured `GET /api?$filter=…` exactly the way
      # the project env var used to, one seam past the one that was closed. Reproduced from

      # the tool result still reported the stored target.
      #

      # operator's own `$TOKEN` merged into evidence — `gori run repeater -H`, a TUI edit
      # over a seeded capture — now ships literally rather than resolving. That is the
      # direction that can only be READ WRONG, never SENT wrong, and a surface that wants
      # both can expand at its own merge seam, where it still knows whose bytes are whose —

      # Three passes, in this order:
      #
      #   * the `$NAME` binding pass, skipped when `resolve_bindings?` says so — for
      #     `evidence?` (somebody else wrote these bytes) or for `expand_bindings?` (the
      #     operator said these bytes ARE the message). See both.
      #   * the SESSION SLOT overlay, after the `$NAME` pass and regardless of EITHER of them.
      #     AFTER, because the slot's own header values may name a binding
      #     (`Authorization: Bearer $SESSION`) and the layer resolves those as it applies
      #     them, against the ACTIVE slot's table — so the order is "resolve the message,
      #     then write this identity over it", never the reverse. REGARDLESS, because a slot
      #     is not a resolution of somebody's tokens; it is the operator answering "send this
      #     AS WHOM" (P4), and replaying a capture under another identity is the single most
      #     common reason to ask. The no-overlay answer has a name and it is `as-captured` —
      #     select it, or select no slot at all, and this is the identity function.
      #
      #     `verbatim` does not change that answer, and the answer is STATED rather than
      #     inherited because the two flags arrived one round apart. `--verbatim` says which
      #     BYTES; a slot says WHOSE identity. They are different questions asked by the same
      #     operator in the same command (`gori run repeater send --slot admin --verbatim`),
      #     and letting the byte answer veto the identity one would send that command as the
      #     STORED identity while the operator named another — a silent substitution in the
      #     one direction P4 refuses. The `$NAME` in a slot header is also the one `$NAME` in
      #     gori that is guaranteed to be a reference and never a payload (`slot_literals`
      #     argues it), so resolving it takes nothing literal away from the operator's bytes:
      #     the overlay writes the slot's own line, and every byte the operator typed that
      #     survives it is untouched.
      #
      #   * the `chrome` TLS preset's client hints (#1174, `Env.client_hints`), last, read off
      #     the User-Agent the first two passes left — so they agree with the UA the socket
      #     gets, whoever wrote it. Regardless of `verbatim` for the slot's reason: the preset
      #     is the operator answering "present as which browser", and a Chrome handshake with
      #     no hints answers it wrongly. A request that already names any `sec-ch-ua*` header
      #     is the operator's own set and gets nothing added.
      #
      # Header-only passes, so Content-Length cannot move and the body stays byte-exact (P7).
      #
      # PUBLIC, and that is the point. These two passes ran INSIDE `send`, where no caller
      # could see their output — so every surface that RECORDS or REPORTS "the outbound
      # request" described the pre-seam draft: `gori run repeater send --record-history` and
      # MCP `send_request{record_history}` wrote a History flow with the slot's
      # `Authorization` line missing (and `$SESSION` still literal in it) while the socket
      # got both, and MCP's `effective_request` — documented as "the request actually put on
      # the wire" — was derived from the same pre-seam bytes. A flow recorded that way is not
      # the request that was sent: replay it, fuzz from it, or scan it and the identity gori
      # actually used is nowhere in the evidence. A caller now takes these bytes once, hands
      # them to `send_wire`, and records exactly what went out.
      #
      # The Fuzzer reaches the same seam through `Fuzz::Sender#send`, which runs the two passes
      # itself; its answer travels back on `Repeater::Result#wire` because a fuzz ROW must keep
      # showing the template (see `Fuzz::Result#wire`). Two shapes, one rule: what is recorded
      # is what was written.
      # ONE generation across both passes: the request's own `$GEN.UUID` and the active slot's
      # header overlay are two expansions of ONE outbound request, and a context per pass would
      # put two different ids on the same socket write.
      #
      # The session slot's before-send refresh (#1233) runs FIRST, before either pass: a slot
      # whose token is about to expire is re-authenticated here, so the `$NAME` pass below
      # already reads the rebound value. Here and not in `send_wire`, because every recording
