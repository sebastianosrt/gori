module Gori
  module Repeater
    # Writes a repeater SEND to History as a captured flow — the "punch a hole" between the
    # workbench (Repeater/Fuzz) and the evidence store (History/Sitemap/HAR/compare).
    #
    # The two used to be entirely separate universes, the way Burp Repeater stays out of Proxy
    # history, and every surface was opt-in. The TUI now records by default
    # (`Settings.repeater_record_history?`), because the tester driving a request by hand is the
    # one whose evidence goes missing; `gori run repeater send --record-history` (off by
    # default) and MCP `send_request`'s `record_history` (on by default) keep the explicit
    # arguments they already had, so no script's behaviour moves under it.
    #
    # Every row this writes carries `source: repeater` (see `Gori::FlowSource`), so History,
    # QL `src:`, the Sitemap lens and Authorize's passive watcher can all tell a send gori made
    # from traffic the target's own client produced.
    #
    # MCP `send_request` has its OWN recorder (`Tools#record_outbound_request`), because it
    # records from a `RequestBuilder::Built` before a `Plan` exists. This one records from a
    # `Plan` + `Result`, the shape the CLI `repeater send` and any future TUI verb already hold.
    module HistoryRecord
      extend self

      # Record `plan`'s outbound request and `result`'s response as one History flow; returns the
      # new flow id. Raises `Gori::Error` when the request row could not be written (a busy/locked
      # store), because a caller that asked to record MUST NOT be told a send is on the record
      # when it is not — the same contract MCP's recorder keeps.
      #
      # `created_at` is passed in (not read here) so a caller can align the stored timestamp with
      # the send it just made, and so this stays free of a wall-clock read on the hot path.
      #
      # `wire` is the request AS IT WENT OUT — `Plan#wire_bytes`, taken by the caller and handed
      # to `Plan#send_wire`, so the row holds the same slice the socket got. REQUIRED, not a
      # defaulted `plan.wire_bytes`: re-deriving it here is precisely what the parameter exists
      # to stop, because the seam it comes through substitutes session bindings and those values
      # can rotate between two reads. A caller that has not been threaded through is a compile
      # error rather than a row that silently differs from the send — the same argument
      # `Sender` makes for requiring an `Outbound` in its constructor.
      # `surface` names which of gori's three faces issued the send, and `source_ref` the
      # repeater session it came from (so a History row can point back at the tab that sent it).
      # `surface` is required for the same reason `wire` is: every caller of this recorder lives
      # inside one surface's own file and knows the answer, and a defaulted one would let a
      # fourth surface record under a third's name.
      # `kind` is WHICH TOOL put the request on the wire. It defaults to `Repeater` because
      # that is what this recorder was written for and what three of its four callers still
      # are; an issue retest (#1036) passes `Retest`, because a step of a check gori ran and
      # a request an operator drove by hand are different facts about the same bytes and the
      # History SRC column exists to tell producers apart.
