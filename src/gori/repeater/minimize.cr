  # tracking-cookie crumbs, query/body params) while keeping the response essentially the
  # same — the equivalent of Caido's "squash" plugin.
  #
  # Pure + TUI/Store-free so it unit-tests without a socket (and the TUI/CLI/MCP could all
  # drive it): the caller injects the network via a `Fuzz::Backend` and the editor-text →
  # wire-bytes translation via a `resolve` proc. HYBRID strategy — a static denylist picks
  # the HEADER candidates (auth/session/custom headers are never touched); then EVERY
  # candidate (denylist headers + Cookie crumbs + query/body params) is ACTIVELY verified:
  # the variant with it removed is re-sent and its response fingerprint compared to a
  # frozen, calibrated baseline. An item is dropped only when the response stays within
  # tolerance.

    # so we never strip an identity header just because THIS response happened to ignore it.

    # `Tui::RepeaterView::PIPELINE_SEP` because nothing in `cli/` or `mcp/` may reach into
    # `tui/`; the dependency runs the other way, so that copy is now an alias of this one and

    # `run` below reads its base text structurally as ONE request (head/body split, then
    # header / cookie / param candidates), so on a group buffer it strips lines out of the
    # operator's SECOND request and reports them as removals from the first. Measured on a
    # saved two-request session through `gori run repeater minimize --apply`:
    #
    #     minimized: removed 2 cookies, 3 params (8 sends)
    #       - [param] %%%\nGET /g2?other      ← the entire second request, as a body PARAM
    #     saved back to session #1
    #     GET /g1 HTTP/1.1 …                  ← request 2 gone from the store, exit 0

    # i.e. operator material destroyed irreversibly and reported as a clean optimisation.

    # headless siblings refuse on, and it lives here so all three cannot drift about what
    # "several requests" means.
    #
    # Deliberately NOT provenance-aware, unlike the TUI's `group_document?`: a stored row
    # carries no record of how many separators it was seeded with, so a CAPTURED body whose
    # own bytes contain a lone `%%%` line is refused here too. That is the same exposure the

    # Cooperative cancel token for one `run`. The caller keeps it, hands a copy to `run`, and
    # calls `#stop` from another fiber; `run` reads `stopped?` immediately before every network
    # send and returns a partial Report instead of issuing it.
    #
    # A caller that cannot FLIP a flag hands a PREDICATE instead (`Stop.new(-> { … })`). That
    # is the MCP server: a `notifications/cancelled` is recorded by its reader fiber into a set
    # keyed by JSON-RPC id, which the tools layer neither holds nor should learn — so it asks
    # the question rather than answering it. Both arms are read at the same three points, so
    # `run` cannot tell which way a stop was armed.
    #
    # A cap is not a stop. `SEND_CAP` bounds a run, but "bounded" is not "over": an operator who
    # closes the repeater tab or leaves the project believes they disconnected from the target,
    # and up to SEND_CAP further probes against that origin is the one thing a pentest tool must
    # not do behind their back. The shape is `DiscoverRun#request_stop` → `Engine#stop`, one
    # layer down because the minimizer is a module function rather than an engine object.
    #
    # WHAT IT CANNOT DO: interrupt a send already on the socket. `Fuzz::Sender` owns that
    # timeout, so the guarantee is "at most one more request completes", not "zero" — which is
    # still the difference between 1 and SEND_CAP. A plain Bool matches `DiscoverRun`'s
