module Gori::Repeater
  # HTTP/1.1 keep-alive connection pool for a sweep's sends.
  #
  # Lives beside `Repeater::Engine` rather than under `Fuzz` because it is pure transport
  # over that engine's own primitives (`dial` / `exchange` / `error`) and has two callers
  # now: `Fuzz::Sender`, which pools ONE origin for a whole sweep, and `Discover::Sender`,
  # which keeps one of these per origin because a crawl derives URLs on several in-scope
  # hosts. Nothing in here knows which sweep it is serving. `Fuzz::ConnPool` remains as an
  # alias, so the fuzz-side name in specs and comments still resolves.
  #
  # `Repeater::Engine.send` dials a fresh connection, exchanges one request, and closes —
  # correct for the Repeater (one operator-triggered send) but the dominant cost of a
  # SWEEP, which sends the same shape thousands of times to one origin. Per request that
  # is a TCP handshake (1 RTT) plus, on https, a TLS handshake (1-2 more RTTs and the
  # asymmetric crypto that goes with it) before a single payload byte moves. Reusing the
  # socket amortises all of it: at concurrency C a run costs ~C handshakes instead of N.
  #
  # gori is a security tool pointed at deliberately odd requests, so reuse is OPT-IN per
  # message, not a blanket keep-alive loop. A connection is parked for reuse only when BOTH
  # ends of the exchange are unambiguously framed:
  #
  #   request  — HTTP/1.1, no `Connection: close`/`Upgrade`, framing that `request_framing`
  #              accepts (so no CL+TE, no obfuscated header), and a body whose LENGTH ON THE
  #              WIRE matches what the head declares. That last check is what keeps a
  #              smuggling payload (a deliberately short/long Content-Length) off a shared
  #              socket: its leftover bytes would be read by the origin as the START of the
  #              next request, and the next payload's result would be somebody else's
  #              response. Those requests get a fresh connection each, exactly as today.
  #   response — no error, not incomplete, HTTP/1.1 (or 1.0 with an explicit keep-alive),
  #              no `Connection: close`, not a 101, and framed by Content-Length or chunked
  #              rather than close-delimited (a close-delimited body ends WITH the socket).
  #
  # Concurrency: the scheduler is single-threaded (no `-Dpreview_mt`), and neither the idle
  # array's `pop`/`push` nor the counter bumps yield, so a worker fiber can never observe a
  # half-updated pool. The array is a LIFO free list — the most recently used socket is the
  # least likely to have hit the origin's idle timeout.
  class ConnPool < Pool
    # A parked socket the origin closed while it sat idle is normal (every server has a
    # keep-alive idle timeout) and must not surface as a failed result. There are two moments
    # it can be discovered, and they are NOT the same fact:
    #
    #   * at CHECKOUT, before a byte of the next request is written (`Checkout::Closed`) —
    #     the origin cannot have seen the request, so it goes out on a fresh connection as a
    #     FIRST send, for any method, unmarked;
    #   * DURING the exchange, because the FIN landed between the probe and the write
    #     (`stale?`) — gori cannot tell whether the origin read it, so only an IDEMPOTENT
    #     request is re-sent, and its Result is marked `retried`.
    #
    # Either way a timeout, or a failure part-way through a response, is NOT retried: the
    # origin may well have processed the request.
    #
    # An origin that refuses reuse outright turns every park into a wasted probe and a redial.
    # After this many consecutive stale checkouts — of EITHER kind — the pool gives up and
    # runs in dial-per-send mode for the rest of the run.
    #
    # On `max_requests`: a stale re-send is not charged against the CAP (CappedBackend counts
    # calls into the Sender, and this retry happens below it), and STALE_GIVE_UP bounds the
    # slack to a handful. It IS counted in what a run REPORTS as requests, though — see
    # `Fuzz::Backend#extra_requests`. The old note claimed the re-send was free because the
    # origin "demonstrably did not process" the first copy; it demonstrably did not ANSWER it,
    # which is a different fact, so a tester working inside an agreed request budget has to be
    # told about the extra one.

    # The methods a closed parked socket may be replayed on.
    #
    # RFC 7230 §6.3.1 permits an automatic retry only for an idempotent request; Go's
    # `http.Transport` retries a reused connection only when the request `isReplayable()`,
    # which is this same set. The class contract above used to justify retrying ANY method
    # with "the request never reached the application", and that claim does not hold: the
    # request-read and the response-write are INDEPENDENT events at the origin, so a
    # load-shedding server, a WAF dropping a payload class, or any drop-on-match origin reads
    # the request in full, acts on it, and closes without answering. `delivered?` cannot see
    # the difference — it only knows no response byte arrived.
    #
    # Measured before this gate existed: a 4-payload POST sweep against an origin that reads
    # every other request and then closes silently put SEVEN POSTs at the origin, reported all
    # four as `200`, and said `0 errors`; the same run with `--no-keep-alive` honestly reported
    # two failures. On a client's production system that is a doubled charge or a doubled
    # account creation, and the sweep's own verdict is inverted for exactly the payloads the
    # origin dropped. A non-idempotent request now gets the honest `no response from …` the
    # unpooled path already returns.
    #
    # PUT and DELETE are idempotent per RFC 9110 §9.2.2 and are deliberately NOT here: gori
    # points deliberately odd requests at targets whose handlers are the thing under test, so
    # "the spec says repeating it is safe" is a weaker guarantee than "no observable side
    # effect is even claimed". This is the set every other HTTP client draws the line at.
