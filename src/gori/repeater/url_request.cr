module Gori::Repeater
  # A hand-authored request that starts from a URL rather than from a capture or a saved session:
  # the raw HTTP/1.1 bytes the repeater engines take, plus the scheme/host/port they dial. Two
  # shapes — STRUCTURED ({method, url, headers, body}) and a verbatim RAW request (which still
  # takes scheme/host/port from the URL, since the engines need a target to dial). Byte-exactness
  # is the engines' contract (P7), so the structured shape only adds Host / Content-Length when
  # the caller omitted them.
  #
  # This used to live inside `MCP::RequestBuilder`, reading a JSON-RPC arguments hash directly.
  # `gori run send` (#1116) is the second surface to need exactly this — a curl-shaped one-off
  # send that frames the request itself — so the typed half moved down here (DESIGN.md §2: option
  # PARSING is per-surface, everything after the normalized options exists once). MCP keeps what
  # is genuinely its own: reading `url`/`headers`/`body` out of JSON, and the `*_base64` forms.
  # Every refusal raises `Gori::Error`, which both surfaces already turn into their own sentence.
