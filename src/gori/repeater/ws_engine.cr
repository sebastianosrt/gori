    # Re-establishes a WebSocket session to an origin and repeaters recorded
    # client→server messages, capturing the server's responses. Unlike Engine /
    # H2Engine (one request → one buffered response), this does the HTTP/1.1
    # upgrade handshake, then a scripted exchange: send ONE outbound message as a
    # masked client frame, drain the server's answer until it goes idle, send the
    # next — until the script runs out, the server sends Close, the socket dies, a
    # capture cap trips, or the drain deadline is reached (see DRAIN_DEADLINE: the
    # idle gap between turns is the engine's own waiting and is not charged to it).
    #
    # INTERLEAVED, not send-all-then-drain. Every recorded client→server message used to go
    # out back to back and only then were the responses read, so a protocol whose Nth message
    # depends on the answer to the (N-1)th — a subscribe/ack exchange, a challenge/response
    # auth, anything request/response-shaped over one socket — was replayed as a burst the
    # server was answering out of step, and the transcript listed every "out" row ahead of
    # every "in" row whatever the wire order had actually been. Draining between messages is
    # also what lets the engine learn MID-script that the peer closed (§5.5.1: nothing follows
    # a CLOSE) or went away, so it stops and reports how far it got instead of writing into a
    # socket nobody is reading.
    #
    # One deliberate limitation remains:
    #  - No permessage-deflate: the handshake omits the extension, AND the live
    #    capture relay stores frame payloads verbatim without decompressing them. So
    #    a session captured over a compressed connection holds COMPRESSED bytes;
    #    replaying them to a server that isn't negotiating deflate sends undecodable
    #    input (and compressed server frames likewise can't be read). To repeater such
    #    a session, capture it with compression disabled in the browser.
