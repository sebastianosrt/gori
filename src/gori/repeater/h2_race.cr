    # HTTP/2 SINGLE-PACKET ATTACK (#1236) — the h2 twin of `Engine.race_h1`.
    #
    # One connection, one stream per request, every request's FINAL frame withheld and then
    # flushed together in a single write, so the server dequeues them in one read and processes
    # the whole group inside the same narrow window. This is the h2 form of the multi-endpoint
    # race the Repeater exposes over marked sub-tabs; the h1 form (`Engine.race_h1`) races N
    # dedicated connections on the last byte.
    #
    # It is deliberately its OWN path and not a widening of `exchange`: `H2Engine::Conn` is a
    # serial one-request-at-a-time holder (`read_response` reads until the ONE stream it owns
    # ends), so putting N streams in flight on one connection needs a demultiplexing reader —
    # a different program, as the `H2Pool` doc block warns. The leaf helpers are shared,
    # though: `parse_request`, `write_header_block`, `header_block`/`data_block`, `merge_block`,
    # `synth_head`, `window_update`, the frame codec and `Reply` all come from `h2_engine.cr`.
    #
    # WITHHELD FRAME. For every member the withheld final frame is a 0-length `DATA(END_STREAM)`:
    # the HEADERS block (and any request body) is written with END_STREAM CLEARED during the
    # prepare phase, and the empty END_STREAM DATA — which needs no flow-control window — is what
    # lands in the single packet. Uniform across bodyless and bodied requests, and it is the
    # shape Burp's single-packet send uses.
    #
    # FLOW CONTROL / SCOPE (MVP). Same origin only (one connection = one host:port — the surface
    # enforces it before building the plan). Request bodies are written during prepare and so
    # draw down the connection's default 65535-byte send window; a group whose bodies exceed it
    # is refused up front (h1 is the path for large bodies), which keeps the prepare phase from
    # ever having to stall for a WINDOW_UPDATE (P6 — the release must not block mid-loop).
    module H2Engine
      # Per-stream response reassembly for the multiplexed read. Mirrors the HEADERS /
      # CONTINUATION / DATA arms of `read_response`, but one instance per in-flight stream so
      # the single frame loop can route each frame to its stream by id. The HPACK `decoder` is
      # the CONNECTION's single decoder (§2.3.2 dynamic table is connection-lifetime): frames
      # are fed in wire-arrival order, and HTTP/2 forbids interleaving one stream's header block
      # with another's, so decoding stays in the order the table was built.
