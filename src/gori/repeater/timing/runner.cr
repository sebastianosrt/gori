  # HOW the pairs are put on the wire each iteration.
  enum Mode
    # Pick the best simultaneous release for the transport (the default): h2 single-packet on one
    # connection, h1 last-byte-sync on two dedicated connections. Both release A and B in the SAME
    # narrow window (#1236), which is what makes their common-mode noise cancel.
    Auto
    # Force the synchronized race even if a caller wanted to override Auto — same path as Auto today,
    # kept distinct so the surfaces can name it and a future Auto heuristic can diverge.
    Race
    # Sequential fallback: send member 0, then member 1, one after the other on their own sends, and
    # ALTERNATE which goes first each iteration (A,B / B,A / …) so first-mover advantage cancels over
    # the run. Noisier than a race (the two are not released together), but works when a race cannot
    # assemble two connections, and is the shape the operator picks with `--interleaved`.

  # Run the differential-timing measurement: send the plan's TWO requests `iterations` times and
  # hand the collected per-pair durations to `Stats.analyze`. The one place all three surfaces share,
  # kept BELOW the surface so parity is structural (DESIGN.md §2) — the TUI wraps this in a fiber, the
  # CLI and MCP call it on their own fiber.
  #
  # The caller has already validated the plan (one origin, one transport, `plan.refusal` clear) and
  # built it from exactly two members — `run` asserts the pair rather than guessing.
  #
  # P6: bounded `iterations` (the surface clamps to `Stats::MAX_ITERATIONS`); no sleep between pairs;
  # the send itself carries the per-send timeout the plan was built with. `cancel`/`progress` default
  # to no-ops so CLI/MCP need not pass them; the TUI passes real closures (marshalled to its fiber).
