module Gori::Repeater::Timing
  # The differential-timing math — pure, stdlib-only, deterministic, spec-testable in isolation
  # (no Store / TUI / Repeater-engine dependency). Given the per-pair durations collected by
  # `Timing::Runner`, it computes each variant's quartile distribution, the paired ORDER bias
  # (in how many pairs did A arrive after B), a two-sided binomial sign test on that bias, and a
  # verdict that refuses to overclaim below a floor of usable pairs. Modeled on `Sequencer::Stats`
  # (`src/gori/sequencer/stats.cr`): a pure module returning one immutable `Report`, p-values from
  # `Math.erfc` (normal tail), a `SMALL_SAMPLE` guard that softens the verdict.
  #
  # WHY ORDER, NOT LATENCY (#1246, PortSwigger "Listen to the whispers", 2024). Absolute latency is
  # dominated by network + server-load noise that a single Repeater send cannot see past. But when A
  # and B are released in the SAME narrow window (the single-packet attack / last-byte-sync race,
  # #1236), that noise is COMMON to both, so the SIGN of (A − B) survives it: if A is genuinely
  # processed slower, A arrives second in a consistent majority of pairs even when both durations
  # jitter together. The quartiles are reported alongside so the operator sees the spread, but the
  # VERDICT is taken on the order bias — a differential oracle, never an absolute-latency SLA.

    # Below this many USABLE pairs (both members answered) the sign test's normal approximation is
    # unreliable and a real effect is as likely swamped as shown, so the verdict is clamped to
    # `Inconclusive` regardless of the count split — the "report confidence without overclaiming"
    # guard (`Sequencer::Stats::SMALL_SAMPLE` is the same number for the same reason).

    # Two-sided significance the sign test must clear to name a slower side. 0.01, not 0.05: this is
    # an oracle an operator will act on, and one differential run is cheap to repeat with a larger N,
    # so the cost of a false "A is slower" is higher than the cost of an unconfirmed "no difference".
