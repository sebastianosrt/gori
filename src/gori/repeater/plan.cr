  # `repeater: invalid target — use scheme://host[:port]/path`), and those strings are part
  # of each surface's contract. So `reason` is the machine-readable fact and the `message`

    # One signal rather than several, because every draft-time policy on this path is off for
    # the same reason and they had already drifted apart across the surfaces:
    #
    #   * the unresolved-`$KEY` refusal. A stored head is full of `$` that no one typed —
    #     OData `$filter`/`$top`, MongoDB `$where`, `$IFS` shell probes, `$user.name` SSTI,
    #     a PHP/JS cookie — and refusing them made those captures unreplayable, while the
    #     refusal's own remedy ("set the variable") would have SUBSTITUTED a value and sent a
    #     different request. A surface still checks its OPERATOR-TYPED parts itself.
    #   * the head's CRLF normalization. It exists because the TUI/Miner editors hold a
    #     request as a line buffer whose fresh lines end in LF; a captured head is already
    #     exact wire bytes, so normalizing can only CHANGE them — promoting a bare-LF
    #     terminator (a front-end/back-end desync primitive gori stores byte-exact) into an
    #     ordinary conformant request.
    #   * `$KEY` SUBSTITUTION ITSELF. This one was left running, and it is the same argument
    #     one step further: a project that happens to define `filter` (or `top`, `where`,
    #     `token`, `user` — ordinary names) rewrote `GET /api?$filter=…` into
    #     `GET /api?PWNED=…` on the wire and then re-framed Content-Length so the corrupted
    #     request looked self-consistent, while MCP's flow path — which reaches the same
    #     end state through `expand_request: false` — sent the stored bytes. Two surfaces,
    #     one flow id, different requests. A capture is replayed as recorded or not at all.
    #
    # A surface that merges OPERATOR-TYPED overrides into evidence bytes (`gori run
    # repeater <flow-id>`'s `-H`/`-b`) must therefore expand those at ITS OWN merge seam,
    # where it still knows which bytes are the operator's. `expand_request: false` remains

    # (`Fuzz::Progress#grpc_stale`, the Repeater transcript's framing note) and does not

    # the byte-exact behaviour it has always had. Reframing is size-preserving either way, so
    # a Content-Length is never invalidated by it.

    # Applied at the SEND seam (`H2Engine.parse_request`), not here, so it also covers a body
