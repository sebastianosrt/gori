    # unlike History's QL→SQL — this matches Crystal-side. Terms are whitespace-
    # separated and AND-joined; a leading `-` negates a field term; an unrecognised
    # or bare token is free text over the title + host.
    #
    #   open                      → free text "open" in title/host
    #   status:open sev:>=high    → only OPEN issues at High or Critical
    #   -status:resolved host:api → not-resolved AND host contains "api"

      # the same knowledge, and an alias missing from the second paints `sev:>=high` (the
      # spelling this class's own doc comment uses) as a typo. `issues_query_spec` pins every
