  # A ready-to-run mining job: THE only place a `Miner::Engine` is constructed.
  #
  # The sequence *expand → origin → locations → buckets → wordlist → sender → engine* used
  # to exist three times over (TUI `MinerView#build_engine`, `gori run mine`, MCP
  # `build_mine_job`), and the copies had drifted:
  #
  # - `Env.expand` ran a different number of times on each. On the MCP mine path a seeding
  #   flow's target was expanded TWICE (once in `mine_request_source`, again in
  #   `fuzz_origin`), so a var whose value itself contains a `$TOKEN` resolved one level
  #   deeper there than on the CLI. The TUI expanded the target ZERO times, so `$HOST` was
  #   dialled literally, and it expanded a hand-authored REQUEST at seed time but a
  #   flow-seeded one never — two answers inside one tab.
  # - The TUI never applied the project's hostname overrides (#367), so a host pinned to a
  #   staging IP in the Project tab was mined at its real DNS address.
  #
  # One builder makes those answers the same by construction: once, here, on both the
  # request and the target. Two consequences worth naming, because they are visible:
  # a TUI mine seeded from a captured flow now resolves `$VAR` in the request body (matching
  # `gori run mine <flow-id>` and MCP, which always did), and a Miner session persisted by a
  # PRE-refactor build holds already-expanded bytes, which this expands a second time —
  # harmless unless one var's value contains another var's token.
  #
  # `outbound` is an ARGUMENT, never built here: Layer-1 strictness differs per surface on
  # purpose (`Outbound.agent` / `.cli` / `.interactive`, DESIGN.md §7), and constructing one
  # in here would silently collapse that distinction.
