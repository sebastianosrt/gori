    #
    # This is what lets a signed API be mined at all: an app that requires every parameter to
    # carry an HMAC or a signed envelope rejects every raw candidate before the miner learns
    # anything, so the hook is the operator's chance to sign/wrap each probe as their engagement
    # requires. `ProcessHook.run` is the same primitive the Rewriter `pipe`, the Decoder `exec:`
    # step and the Probe `exec` rule use — no shell, argv exec'd directly (P1).
    #
    # FAILURE IS A SKIP, NEVER A CLEAN NEGATIVE. On a spawn failure, timeout, non-zero exit or
    # oversized output this returns `{nil, reason}` and the caller SKIPS the candidate with that
    # reason (`Miner::HookBackend` turns it into an errored send `Result`, which every miner send
    # site already refuses to read as a clean miss — #818 made this argument for Probe's `exec`
    # rule and it holds identically here: a hook that never ran must not make a candidate look
    # like a confirmed absence). A successful run returns `{stdout, nil}`.
    #
    # Note `ok?` excludes an `output_lost` result, so an empty `stdout` here is a hook that
