  # parameters a server accepts but that aren't in the captured request. It stuffs a

  # the batch to isolate the responsible name — far cheaper than one name per request.

  # Store or the TUI. `Miner::Plan`, the run builder above it, does reach Store types
  # (through Outbound / HostOverrides). The one engine drives the TUI Miner tab,
  # `gori run mine`, and the MCP mine_* tools.
