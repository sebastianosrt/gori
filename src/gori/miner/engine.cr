    #
    # A mine is LATENCY-bound and its critical path is this tree's DEPTH: isolating one name
    # in a K-bucket takes ~log_b(K) sequential round trips at branch factor b, and — since the
    # tail of a bisection is only 1-2 tasks wide — that chain is a floor no amount of
    # concurrency can lower (see `drain`: at concurrency 40 the pool sat ~half idle waiting on
    # it). Widening the split lowers the floor: log₄ is half of log₂.
    #
    # It buys the depth WITHOUT costing requests. To isolate a lone positive, a b-way split
    # sends `b` probes at each of `log_b(K)` levels = `b·log_b(K)` = `2·log₂(K)` for b∈{2,4} —
    # the same count a binary search sends, in wider, shallower waves. When a bucket holds
    # SEVERAL positives it recurses into several children, but the total still falls, not
    # rises: the pruning tree over K names has ~K·b/(b−1) nodes (2K binary, ~1.33K at b=4), so
    # a dense bucket costs FEWER probes under 4-ary (measured −6%…−11% at ≥8 positives per
    # 128). Under `--max-requests` that means 4-ary reaches full coverage inside the same
    # budget a binary run would — it never finds fewer. That is why `BISECT_MAX_WAYS` caps b
    # for DEPTH returns, not to bound a request cost that only shrinks.
    #
    # Tied to `@concurrency` on purpose, floored at 2: widening past the worker count cannot
    # help — the extra pieces just queue — so a serial/paced run (concurrency 1-2) keeps the
    # exact binary tree it had, request-for-request, and only a run with idle workers to fill

        # A STOP ends the retry chain. It was honoured everywhere else in the run — the
        # dispatcher breaks, a worker skips the bucket it just took — and invisible only here,
        # where a retry is a NEW request: measured, a `stop` on the first errored bucket put
        # `retries` more requests on the wire per in-flight worker after `mine_stop` returned,
        # and MCP's ceilings (`retries` up to 1000, `retry_pause` 500 ms by default) scale that
        # to 1000 requests and ~8 minutes EACH. Checked on BOTH sides of the pause, so neither a
        # stop that arrived during the send nor one during the pause costs another. Same shape,
        # same reason, as `Sequencer::Engine#send_with_retries` and `Fuzz::Engine#run_one`.
