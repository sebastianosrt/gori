    # heard of — each `name_len` bytes long. Every probe the run then sends at that location is

    # handed unknown parameters is present on both sides of the diff and cancels. What is left
    # is what the candidate itself did.

    # `echo` is how many bytes of response the page returns per byte of parameter NAME it was
    # handed — measured from two controls of the same width whose names are different lengths.
    # It is 0 for a page that does not print what it received and ~1 for one that does, and it
    # is the only honest way to compare a byte COUNT against a control whose names gori chose:
    # the difference in name bytes is a difference the miner created, so the length band is
    # widened by `echo × those bytes` and only a move bigger than that counts as signal.
    # `length_tol`/`words_tol`/`lines_tol` are the bands to judge a probe against WHEN THIS IS
