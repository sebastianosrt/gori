module Gori::Miner
  # A run's request-time macro (#1350), wired as a `Fuzz::Backend` DECORATOR — the same seam
  # `HookBackend` uses, and for the same reason: a mine's requests do not all leave from one
  # place. Baseline calibration, every bucket probe and every finding's confirmation go through
  # `@backend.send`, so wrapping the backend is the one seam that reaches all of them — and it
  # MUST reach the baseline, because an app that rotates a token per request answers an
  # un-tokened calibration probe with the same 403 it gives a candidate, and a baseline of 403s
  # makes every real response look like a finding.
  #
  # Each `send` is one request as far as the macro's cadence is concerned: the miner has no
  # fixed candidate list (its probes are a search, each depending on the last), so the unit the
  # cadence counts is the request the engine puts on the wire. `every 1` therefore gives every
  # probe a value of its own, and — through `Lane`'s epochs — runs the mine one probe at a time.
  # The plan says so (`Plan#request_macro_info`) before the first request.
  #
  # Wrapped OUTSIDE the raw sender (and outside `HookBackend`, so a hook signs bytes that already
  # carry the fresh value) and INSIDE the engine's `CappedBackend`: the cap refuses a send before
  # the macro's steps run once the budget is spent, and the steps are charged to the same cap.
