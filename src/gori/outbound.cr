module Gori
  # THE outbound chokepoint for gori-originated ("active") traffic.
  #
  # Everything gori sends that did NOT come from a proxied client — Repeater sends,
  # Fuzzer/Miner/Sequencer sweeps, Repeater minimize, Probe's active checks — bypasses
  # the proxy's own per-request gate (Interceptor/ClientConn) by dialing an upstream
  # directly. The invariant "no active request leaves gori without a scope decision" was
  # therefore enforced by CONVENTION at ~20 call sites across three surfaces (TUI,
  # `gori run`, MCP), and had been silently broken more than once — a new tool, or a new
  # send path inside an old tool, simply forgot to gate.
  #
  # `Outbound` makes the decision a VALUE that an active sender cannot be constructed
  # without (`Fuzz::Sender`, `Repeater::Sender`), so forgetting it is a compile error
  # rather than a security hole. It carries both layers of the gate:
  #
  #   Layer 1 (`check`)        — the surface-selected include/allowlist decision, made
  #                              before side effects. Its strictness is the ONE thing that
  #                              legitimately differs per surface (see `Gate`); a Repeater
  #                              sender repeats it on the final wire target.
  #   Layer 2 (`sweep_block` / — the per-send HARD gate: Sandbox mode (and, for automated
  #            `send_block`)     sweeps, explicit EXCLUDE rules). Identical on every
  #                              surface, and applied even when Layer 1 was waived.
  #
  # Reload semantics are uniform (DESIGN.md P5, pending #353): the scope is re-read from
  # its store at most once per `RELOAD_INTERVAL` before a Layer-2 check, so a mid-run
  # EXCLUDE or Sandbox toggle stops an in-flight sweep on every surface. Previously only
  # MCP did this; `gori run` snapshotted the rules at start-up and the TUI honoured a
  # change only as a side effect of its own data_version poll.
  class Outbound
    # The per-send error strings an automated sweep's blocked Result carries. Stable —
    # `Fuzz::Engine` surfaces them as a row error and specs assert on them.
    #
    # Layer 2 has TWO independent reasons with different remedies, so they get different
    # sentences. They used to collapse into one bare "blocked by scope", which is also the
    # wording of the Layer-1 abort — so an operator who had just passed `--allow-unscoped`
    # read the same three words back and reasonably concluded the flag had done nothing.
    # `Discover::Engine::SCOPE_REFUSED` already names both possibilities for the same
    # gate; this splits them so the message names the ONE that fired, and its exit.
    SANDBOX_SWEEP_ERROR = "blocked by sandbox (out of scope) — add a scope include rule, or turn Sandbox off"
    EXCLUDE_SWEEP_ERROR = "blocked by a scope exclude rule — excludes hold even under --allow-unscoped"
    # The refusal for ONE hand-authored Repeater send. Distinct wording because Sandbox
    # is the only rule that stops these (see `send_block`), and the TUI/CLI show it verbatim.
    SANDBOX_ERROR = "blocked by sandbox (out of scope)"

    # True for a Layer-2 refusal — the two strings `sweep_block` returns above and nothing
    # else does. Such a refusal is PERMANENT for a retrying caller: the scope does not move
    # between two attempts a `retry_pause` apart (a reload is throttled to `RELOAD_INTERVAL`),
    # and `CappedBackend#send` charges the request cap BEFORE the gate refuses — so re-asking
    # spends a second request for an answer that is already fixed.
    #
    # ONE HOME, the same rule AGENTS.md states for `Codec::Http1.request_token_safe?`: this
    # predicate had three private copies (`Sequencer::Engine`/`Miner::Engine`'s
    # `permanent_refusal?`, `Fuzz::Engine#gate_refused?`), which is exactly how the Sequencer
    # came to be missing two of the constants while its siblings had all of them. A new
    # Layer-2 refusal is now added here once.
    #
    # `Fuzz::CappedBackend::CAP_ERROR` is deliberately NOT folded in, even though two of the
    # three callers also treat it as permanent: it is a tool's constant, and `outbound.cr`
    # requires only `scope`/`store`/the codec — a core chokepoint reaching into `fuzz/` would
    # invert the layering (DESIGN.md §2.1). It is also counted differently on the Fuzzer path
    # (a cap stop is not a `@blocked` payload unit — see `Fuzz::Engine#run_one`), so the cap
    # question stays with the callers that ask it.

    # absolute-form target to its path+query and rebuild it against the dial host.

    # This was previously only done on MCP's `send_request` (`request_scope_url`); the sweep

    # and why only the exclude side does.
