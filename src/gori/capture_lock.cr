module Gori
  # Advisory capture lock keyed on the DB FILE. The FIRST live instance to open a
  # database holds a lock file (BSD flock) for the session's lifetime; a SECOND
  # instance of the SAME database fails to acquire it and opens VIEW-ONLY (no second
  # listener — it live-refreshes off the shared DB via the data_version poll). A
  # DIFFERENT database — even one sharing the same directory, e.g. two `--db` files —
  # has its OWN lock file, so it still captures on its own port. Callers hand in the
  # lock-file path via `try_at`/`held_at?` (see Project#capture_lock_path, which keys
  # it on the db file: `<db_path>.capture.lock`). The legacy `try`/`held?`/`path`
  # take a DIRECTORY and lock `<dir>/.capture.lock`; the canonical registry db keeps
  # that per-directory path so the registry's dir-based `held?` guards (delete/rename)
  # still detect a live capturer with no regression. The lock is auto-released when
  # the File is closed OR when the owning process dies (flock is per open-file-
  # description, freed by the kernel on close / exit).
  #
  # Caveats: flock is advisory and a no-op on many network filesystems (NFS), so on
  # such a mount the lock gives no protection — the proxy's own port-probe fallback
  # is the second line of defense. The lock FILE persists (empty) after release;
  # its mere existence is NOT "held" — only a FAILED flock means another instance
  # is capturing.

      # spells out the reasoning): every gori dir is owner-only 0700 because the captured
      # traffic DB lands in it, and a plain mkdir_p leaves it at the umask, world-traversable
      # on a shared host. This is the sibling that never got that fix, and the loose mode would
      # be permanent — `capture_status`'s deliberate `tighten: false` never tightens an
      # existing dir. `tighten: false` here for the same reason it is there: a `--db` project
      # can borrow a parent directory that is not gori's to chmod.
