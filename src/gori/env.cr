    # survive. The layer that runs LAST is therefore the one that consumes:
    #
    #   * `Preserve` — the env-var pass. `$$` is copied through as `$$` and the token behind
    #     it is NOT read, so an env var named `id` cannot resolve into `$$id`.
    #   * `Consume` — `expand_bindings`, the send seam every wire path passes through
    #     (`Repeater::Sender`, `Fuzz::Sender`, `Discover::Engine`). `$$` → one literal `$`,
    #     the token behind it left alone.
    #
    # A surface whose env pass IS the last pass asks for `Consume` explicitly. An EVIDENCE path
    # expands nothing the capture brought and so unescapes nothing: a `$$` in captured bytes is
    # two bytes the origin sent, not an escape the operator typed. The TUI intercept editor is
    # both — its pass is the last one before the origin, and its buffer is a held message — and
    # evidence wins: it consumes no escape (#1416, `InterceptView#edited_wire`).
    #
    # One place deliberately keeps `$$` as two bytes: a DIAL TUPLE (a `--target`, a URL, an
    # SNI). Those run `Env.expand` once and are never re-scanned by a send seam, so nothing
    # consumes the escape — and there is nothing to escape FROM, because `$` is not a legal
    # byte in a hostname. `unresolved` still walks the escape correctly, so a
    # `$$` there cannot be mis-reported as an unresolved name; it simply fails to resolve as a
    # host, visibly, which is the honest outcome.
    #
    # Escapes pair left to right, one `$` out per `$$` in: `$$id` → `$id`, `$$$$` → `$$`,
    # `$$$id` → `$` followed by an INTERPRETED `$id`.
    #
    # A BARE-MODE KNOB ONLY. Under `Syntax::Namespaced` the escape is namespaced too —
    # `$$ENV.X` and `$$BIND.X` are escapes, each consumed by the pass that owns that namespace
    # (`Owns`), a bare `$$` is two literal bytes with the second sigil re-examined, and there is
    # therefore nothing left for a "which pass consumes" flag to decide. `unescape_set` maps

    # `$NAME` has exactly ONE syntax and TWO resolution times, and the split is the
    # point of the feature. An env var is BUILD-time: every plan builder expands it
    # once before a run starts (#356), and a name that resolves to nothing is refused
    # there (#519/#525). A BINDING is SEND-time: its value is observed from a response
    # and may change between request 1 and request 20 of the same run, which is exactly
    # the run that otherwise produces a page of 401s.
    #
    # So the two layers are never merged for expansion. `expand`'s default stays
    # `effective_vars` — build-time and static — and the send pass below resolves the
    # binding half ALONE. That is what keeps #356's "one Env.expand, at plan-build"

    # rule (#525, `unbound`'s doc above) is not weakened by saying something HERE.
    #
    # Because with an empty binding table `expand_bindings` passes `$SESSION` through as five
    # literal bytes, and the binding table is memory-only: EVERY `gori run … --slot` process
    # starts with an empty one, so every such run without `--bind-from` sends the literal.
    # Exit 0, no warning, HTTP 200 from the origin, and the operator reads it as a session
    # that worked. In Authorize it is worse than useless: the identity goes out
    # unauthenticated, draws the same 401 as anonymous, and the row aggregates to `enforced` —
    # a MISSED bypass, the one direction `Authorize::Identity`'s doc says this tool must not
    # fail in.
    #
    # A REPORT and not a refusal, deliberately. A guard with no exit costs more than the loss
    # it prevents (the #525 measurement: a probe scan losing 7 of 9 active checks on a flow,
    # reported as scanned), and an operator who genuinely wants the four bytes `$SES…` on the
    # wire already has the escape: `$$SESSION`, the one escape this module defines, which
    # `expand` consumes and this scan honours for the same reason.

    # One name a slot header will ship LITERALLY, and WHY — because the two causes have different
    # remedies and only one of them is fixable by binding.
    #
    # `bare_spelled` marks the second cause, and it is the worse one: a `$SESSION` under a

    # re-framed afterwards, so a `$NAME` in a BODY shipped a Content-Length describing the
    # UNEXPANDED body: on a pipelined send-group the origin read the declared prefix and the
    # remainder became the front of the next request line — gori desyncing its own connection
    # and putting the session token on the wire as a method. A value shorter than the token
    # hangs the connection instead. On h2 a `content-length` disagreeing with the DATA frames
    # is malformed outright (RFC 9113 §8.1.2.6).
    #
    # A DELTA and not a resync, because both framing modes have to survive: an operator with
    # auto-Content-Length OFF (`Repeater`) or `update_content_length` off (`Fuzz`) authored a
    # deliberate mismatch as their payload, and a resync would silently destroy it. Shifting
    # by what the substitution actually added keeps that offset exactly, while a request that
    # WAS in sync stays in sync. It is also why this sits inside `expand_bindings` rather than
    # at the five send seams: the seam that forgets is the one that desyncs.
    # Only the DIGITS move. The field name's spelling, the colon and the optional whitespace
    # on either side are copied through byte-exact, because on this codebase's requests they
    # are the payload: `content-length:   2` with lower-case and extra OWS IS a
    # header-parsing-discrepancy probe, and canonicalising it to `Content-Length: 2` silently
    # sends a different test than the operator wrote.

    # a desync probe whose whole content is the RELATIONSHIP between the two numbers; moving

    #     `WS.encode` writes AFTER this pass, so there is nothing here to re-sync.

    # CRLF normalization is HEAD-ONLY: a raw `0x0A` inside the BODY is just a byte

    # (silently, since Content-Length gets resynced to the corrupted body

    # grammar. That is what makes the answer trustworthy: a name reported here is a
    # name `expand` tried to resolve at that same offset and could not, so it is a
    # name that lands on the wire literally.
    #

    # char-based (`text.chars`), and the text this runs over is routinely not valid
    # UTF-8 (a captured flow's body loaded verbatim). `String#chars` decodes lossily
    # to U+FFFD, which can both invent and destroy a token boundary — the exact
    # hazard `expand` was made byte-level to avoid.
    #
    # `deferred` names are skipped: a name an extract rule declares is not unresolved, it
    # is resolved LATER (see `unbound`). Without that, `$SESSION` in a Fuzzer template

    # which is the thing #525's shape exists to prevent.

    # `deferred: nil` is the DIAL-TUPLE reading and it says something stronger than "report the

    # table said "resolved" about a host that then reached the resolver spelled `$BIND.HOST`.
    # With `deferred` GIVEN (the request-body callers, whose bytes the send seam re-scans with

    # cap exists to produce (`$EN` cut by a span is a Literal, a NAME cut mid-way is truncated

    # `escapes` names the escapes this reader should REPORT. A namespace outside it comes back
