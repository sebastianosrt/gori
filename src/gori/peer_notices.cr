  # What a PEER changed under a running session, turned into the line the operator reads (#772).
  #
  # A peer is another process on the same project db — an MCP agent, `gori run …`, a second TUI.
  # Since #771 a peer's write reaches this session's LIVE objects, so it can change what this
  # session puts on the wire; the operator was never told. This is the policy for which of those
  # changes is worth interrupting them over, and in what words.
  #
  # Deliberately OUTSIDE `Gori::Tui`, and deliberately not holding a `Notifications`: the headless
  # `gori run capture` adopts exactly the same peer writes on its own reload loop and owes the
  # operator the same sentence through `Log`. The one existing cross-surface warning (the CA trust
  # store) is hand-written twice — once for the ring at `app.cr` and once for STDERR — and the two
  # can drift apart. One builder, two emitters, no drift.
  #
  # Pure and clock-injected (`now` is a parameter, never `Time.instant` read in here) so the whole
  # policy is testable without a `Runner`, which no spec can construct.
