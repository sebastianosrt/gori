module Gori
  # A per-project /etc/hosts: maps a hostname to the address the proxy should DIAL for it.
  # The override changes ONLY the TCP connect target — SNI, the certificate hostname,
  # the Host header, and the upstream-reuse pool key all keep the original hostname
  # (see Proxy::Upstream.dial). Owned by the TUI (the Project tab's HOST OVERRIDES
  # pane), persisted per project, and ALSO layered under a global set
  # (Settings.hostname_overrides) — the project layer wins on a host collision.
  #
  # The value is `IP` or `IP:PORT` (see `Gori::DialAddress`): a bare IP keeps the request's
  # own port, which is what every entry written before ports existed says.
  #
  # Entries are read on the PROXY hot path (connect_address) while the TUI fiber mutates
  # them (add/update/remove), so every cross-fiber access is Mutex-guarded — exactly
  # like Scope. TWO mutexes, though, and the split matters: see the constructor.
  class HostOverrides
    # One override. Immutable: rebuilt on every load/mutate (never edited in place).
    #
    # `ip` is the column name and the historical spelling; it holds a dial ADDRESS, which may
    # carry a port. Kept as `ip` rather than renamed because the persisted column is `ip` and
    # this round must not touch the schema — `address` is the accessor that says what it is.

      getter id : Int64
      getter host : String # `OverrideHost.key` form: lowercased, no trailing root dot

      # Guards `@entries` ONLY, and every critical section it has is a pointer read or a
      # pointer swap. The store round-trip that used to sit inside it does not: `exec_task` parks
      # the calling fiber on its reply channel until the writer fiber has run the op, and with
      # `busy_timeout=5000` a PEER process holding the write lock can put that reply five seconds
      # away. That wait is TWO stalls, and only the second one is this mutex's business. SQLite's
      # busy handler waits by sleeping inside C on whichever fiber is running the statement, and
      # the scheduler is single-threaded (no -Dpreview_mt), so those sleeps stall the WHOLE
      # process — every fiber, mutex or no mutex; nothing here can fix that (`write_transaction`'s
      # `try_lock` is what keeps the idle indexer out of it). What the mutex added on top is the
      # queue wait — the writer's backlog ahead of our op plus the reply hop, which is time the
      # scheduler is running normally — and `connect_address` takes this same mutex on every
      # proxied request, so holding it across the write serialized every dial in a project that
      # has any override at all behind an unrelated store write. The writers below serialise
      # against each other on @write_mutex instead, which the read path never touches.
      @mutex = Mutex.new

      # holds and the proxy dials from. It is deliberately not claimed as more than that: the
      # MCP tools and the CLI each `HostOverrides.load` an instance of their own per call, so
      # they carry their own lock and never contend with this one. They are answered the same
      # way a peer PROCESS is, which is the case that has to work anyway: `INSERT OR IGNORE`
      # plus the post-write reload verify below. The residue is that two writers racing the
      # same host make the loser's verify fail, and MCP reports that deterministic duplicate
      # as retryable — narrow enough to leave, but it is a race, not an atomicity guarantee.
