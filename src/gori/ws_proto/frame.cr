module Gori
  # The real-time framings that ride *inside* a WebSocket, decoded at display time.
  #
  # gori decoded exactly one of them for a long while — GraphQL-over-WS (`Gori::GraphqlWs`) —
  # and every other framing rode raw: a Socket.IO event showed as `42["chat",{…}]`, a SignalR
  # hub invocation as a `0x1e`-terminated JSON blob, a STOMP frame as a text lump. Those
  # envelopes are where the interesting work lives (event-name enumeration, hub-method
  # authorization gaps, CSWSH against a named event), so the operator was reading the envelope
  # by eye on the one surface built to read framings for them.
  #
  # This is `GraphqlWs`'s pattern generalised, not a new subsystem: a pure display-time
  # projection over the `ws_messages` transcript, no new table, no new capture. Each
  # subprotocol is one module under `ws_proto/` exposing the same two entry points —
  #
  #   `.decode(payload : Bytes) : Array(Decoded)?`  nil ⇒ "not my framing"
  #   `.hinted?(subprotocol : String) : Bool`       does a negotiated subprotocol name me?
  #
  # — and the coordinator in `ws_proto.cr` runs them.
  #
  # ## P7: the frame bytes stay the truth
  #
  # A frame that does not parse as the sniffed protocol contributes NOTHING and stays visible
  # raw in the MESSAGES pane. The decoded pane is a lens, exactly as the GRAPHQL pane is —
  # never a guess, never a rewrite.

    # `strong` is the whole reason detection does not guess. A Socket.IO `2` (ping) is one
    # ASCII digit and a SockJS `h` (heartbeat) is one ASCII letter — either could be an
    # ordinary text message in an unrelated protocol, so neither may ENABLE a decoder on its
    # own. Only an unmistakable envelope (`42["chat",…]`, an `0x1e`-terminated hub record, a
    # NUL-terminated STOMP frame) is `strong`, and a protocol with no strong frame and no
    # handshake hint decodes nothing at all.

    # compatibility, so one `{"type":99}` from a newer hub made the real invocations packed
