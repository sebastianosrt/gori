module Gori
  # The ONE host-pattern dialect, shared by Scope's `host` rules (Scope::Rule#host_match?),
  # TLS passthrough, upstream rules and the project's Destination host gate. Shared
  # deliberately: a pattern the operator learned in one editor must mean the same thing in
  # another, and copies of the glob/suffix decision would be places to drift.
  #
  #   acme.test    → the host itself AND any subdomain (api.acme.test)
  #   *.acme.test  → a glob (File.match?) — matches subdomains but NOT the bare host
  #   ::1 / [::1]  → an IPv6 literal; bracketed and bare forms both match either form
  #
  # Matching is case-insensitive. Patterns are COMPILED once (see Compiled) because both
  # callers evaluate the same patterns repeatedly on the proxy hot path — per captured row
  # for scope and per destination dial for routing/passthrough.
  module HostPattern
    # The form both sides of a host match compare: a SURROUNDING bracket pair peeled, and every
    # TRAILING ROOT DOT stripped.
    #
    # Brackets, because an IPv6 host arrives bracketed on some URL paths and bare on the
    # CONNECT/tunnel path, and a pattern must reach both.
    #
    # The root dot, because `acme.test.` and `acme.test` are one name to every resolver and gori
    # captures the `Host:` bytes as they arrived — a browser sends the dot when the user types
    # one, which is exactly why the dotted spelling is a standing WAF/cache bypass. To a string
    # compare it was a different host, so `acme.test.` escaped a scope EXCLUDE, a TLS-passthrough
    # entry and an upstream route written for `acme.test`, each in the permissive direction; and a
    # pattern typed WITH the dot was a rule no request could ever match. `OverrideHost.key` folds
    # it on the host-override table and `Upstream.strip_root_dot` on the self-loop gate, both for
    # this reason — this is the third table and the one the other two cite.
    #
    # `rstrip` rather than `chomp`, like `OverrideHost.key`: the pathological `acme.test..` folds
    # too instead of leaving a dot behind that still matches nothing.
    #
    # A GLOB pattern is matched against the UN-bared text (see `matches_bare?`), so a glob typed
    # with a trailing dot stays a rule that matches nothing — exactly as a bracketed glob does,
    # and `Scope.sql_native_host?` keeps the SQL lens agreeing with it either way.

    # `host` lowercased — returning `host` ITSELF when lowering it would change nothing.
    #
    # `String#downcase` builds a fresh String unconditionally, and this runs on the proxy hot
    # path once per host rule per request (`Compiled#matches?`) — a captured host is very
    # nearly always already lowercase, so that copy was pure garbage. The scan answers the
    # same question the copy would: an ASCII byte outside `A-Z` is its own lowercase, so a
    # string holding neither an ASCII capital nor a byte >= 0x80 is unchanged by `downcase`,
    # and anything else (including every non-ASCII case-folding rule) falls through to it.
