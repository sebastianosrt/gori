  # - `gori ca`                     → print root CA path (or PEM); `ca regenerate` rotates it
  # - `gori run <sub>`              → non-interactive CLI (see Gori::CLI::Run)
  # - `gori mcp`                    → MCP (Model Context Protocol) server over stdio
  # - `gori wizard`                 → interactive first-run setup wizard (bind/theme/companion)

  # - `gori update`                 → channel-aware self-update (binary / brew / snap / AUR)
