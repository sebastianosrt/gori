module Gori
  # The SQL half of a Scope rule, for the shapes where a NATIVE SQL spelling and the
  # in-memory evaluation do not mean the same thing.
  #
  # `Scope#filter` and `Scope::Rule#matches?` are two implementations of one predicate, and
  # scope.cr's own invariant is that they "never disagree". Three ways they did:
  #
  #   · `lower()` — SQLite's built-in folds ASCII only; Crystal's `String#downcase` folds the
  #     whole of Unicode. A `string` rule `/über` matched a captured `/Über` in the live gate
  #     and nothing in History.
  #   · GLOB vs File.match? — Crystal reads `{a,b}` as brace alternation, SQLite GLOB reads
  #     the braces literally. An include `*.acme.{test,dev}` matched three hosts live and none
  #     in History; an EXCLUDE with braces carved out nothing in History (fail-open).
  #   · brackets — `Rule#host_match?` peels a surrounding `[...]` off the FLOW HOST as well as
  #     off the pattern, so a flow captured as `[::1]` (what `URI#host` hands back for the
  #     absolute-form target a plain-HTTP forward-proxy request arrives in) was in scope live
  #     but unreachable by any host rule in SQL. That one is fixed in SQL directly — see
  #     `Scope::HOST_BARE` — because it applies to the fast path too.
  #
  # Rather than keep a second dialect in sync by hand, the diverging shapes call the FIRST
  # implementation from SQL: `gori_host_match` is `HostPattern::Compiled`, and
  # `gori_ci_contains` is `downcase.includes?`. Registered per pooled connection beside the
  # byte-safe REGEXP (see SafeRegexp and Store.configure_connections).
