    # --- Repeater workbench tabs (persisted + cross-session synced) -------------
    # Writes go through exec_task on the long-lived writer connection. That IS a
    # different connection from the read pool, so PRAGMA data_version (polled on a
    # pool connection) DOES bump for our own commits — the TUI's apply_external_change
    # / reconcile must soft-sync and skip unchanged rows, not assume "own writes are
    # invisible". Callers that full-restore on every poll self-clobber.

    # `repeaters.request` is declared TEXT (schema.cr) but every CURRENT insert/update
    # binds it as `Bytes`, which SQLite stores as BLOB regardless of the column's
    # declared affinity — see the V2 migration's `CAST(request AS BLOB)` comment for the
    # history (an older gori bound it as a Crystal `String`, producing TEXT-storage-class
    # rows that silently truncated at an embedded NUL on read). That migration fixed data
    # existing at upgrade time, but it can't protect a row written LATER by a mismatched
    # writer — e.g. a `gori mcp`/TUI process still running an out-of-date binary against
    # an already-migrated project db, which is exactly how gori is meant to be run
    # long-lived alongside a dev rebuild. Every read below casts defensively so a
    # TEXT-storage-class value coerces to Bytes instead of `rs.read(Bytes)` raising an
    # unhandled DB::ColumnTypeMismatchError — which, left unhandled, doesn't just fail
    # that one row: `repeaters`/`repeaters_meta`/`repeaters_mcp` read ALL rows in a single
    # query, so one bad row crashed the entire CLI/TUI/MCP process and blocked every
    # Repeater operation for the project. CAST is a documented no-op on an
    # already-BLOB-storage value, so this never changes behavior for the common case.
