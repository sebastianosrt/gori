    # Writes go through exec_task on the long-lived writer connection. That IS a
    # different connection from the read pool, so PRAGMA data_version (polled on a
    # pool connection) DOES bump for our own commits — the TUI's apply_external_change
    # / reconcile must soft-sync and skip unchanged rows, not assume "own writes are
    # invisible". Callers that full-restore on every poll self-clobber.

    # `repeaters.request` is declared TEXT (schema.cr) but every CURRENT insert/update
    # binds it as `Bytes`, which SQLite stores as BLOB regardless of the column's
    # declared affinity — see the V2 migration's `CAST(request AS BLOB)` comment for the
    # history (an older gori bound it as a Crystal `String`, producing TEXT-storage-class
    # rows that silently truncated at an embedded NUL on read). That migration fixed data
    # existing at upgrade time, but it can't protect a row written LATER by a mismatched
    # writer — e.g. a `gori mcp`/TUI process still running an out-of-date binary against
    # an already-migrated project db, which is exactly how gori is meant to be run
    # long-lived alongside a dev rebuild. Every read below casts defensively so a
    # TEXT-storage-class value coerces to Bytes instead of `rs.read(Bytes)` raising an
    # unhandled DB::ColumnTypeMismatchError — which, left unhandled, doesn't just fail
    # that one row: `repeaters`/`repeaters_meta`/`repeaters_mcp` read ALL rows in a single
    # query, so one bad row crashed the entire CLI/TUI/MCP process and blocked every
    # Repeater operation for the project. CAST is a documented no-op on an

    # remove the row inside that window, and an `UPDATE … WHERE id = ?` that matched nothing

    # `#1 (gone)` for as long as it took to open one more tab, and then resolved,
    # `stale: false`, to an UNRELATED request: an issue's evidence pointer confidently naming a
    # different URL, in the TUI overlay, both exports and MCP `list_links`. V40 made the id
    # permanent; the cascades stay, because a pointer at a tab that is gone still points at
    # nothing an operator can open.
    #
    # A flow link left dangling by retention pruning cannot re-bind: both prune paths delete
    # from the bottom (`WHERE id <= cutoff`), so `MAX(id)` survives and the next insert is
    # `max + 1`. Explicit History deletes and clears remove their links in the same transaction
    # because those paths can reuse ids. "Gone" is genuinely more informative than absent
    # THERE. Here it is a pointer that silently starts lying, which is worse than either.
    #
    # An issue's retest steps name repeaters with the same `ref_kind`/`ref_id` pair and had

    # issue. They are DETACHED here rather than deleted: a step carries the operator's role
    # and assertion, and silently dropping one on a tab close shrinks the retest — a run of
    # the steps left can then PASS an issue its missing step would have failed. A detached
