    # keeps no per-URL flow id, so the URLs outlive every id that could have pointed back at a
    # row. Storing the id beside each URL would make this exact and is the better shape; it
    # needs a `probe_issues` migration and a second array kept index-aligned across the store,
    # the headless `Probe::Group` fold and both export surfaces, so it is not this change.
    #
    # `host` narrows the scan to `idx_flows_sitemap`'s leading column, and the caller always
    # has it — a probe issue group is keyed by (code, host), so every URL on its list is on
    # that host. The `target` predicate covers both capture shapes at once (absolute-form rows
    # store the whole URL, origin-form rows store the bare path), and the survivors are then
    # re-derived through `FlowRow.url_of` rather than trusted: `/x` captured on http:8080 and

    # THE METHOD IS THE FIRST SORT KEY, and it is why `prefer_method` exists. A URL is not an
    # endpoint: `GET /v1/me` and `POST /v1/me` are one (host, target) pair and two exchanges,
    # and a finding that fired on one must not open the other — `representative_flow_id` keys
    # on the method for exactly this reason, and a probe group records none, so the caller
