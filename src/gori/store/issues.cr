    # Issue notes can arrive as arbitrary bytes through `--notes-file` or `--notes-stdin`.

    # CAST keeps the read length-aware without changing existing rows or their storage class.

    # 0 == not persisted. Three callers guard on that, so the id must come from the
    # COMMITTED signal, not from the local the closure captured: the closure runs inside
    # the transaction, but the batch can still roll back afterwards (a COMMIT-time
    # SQLITE_FULL/IOERR, or an unrelated co-submitted write raising — writer_loop batches
    # up to BATCH_MAX ops from every fiber into one transaction). Returning the captured
    # id there handed out the rowid of an issue that does not exist, and the next issue
    # created is handed that same id — `sqlite_sequence` rolls back with the insert, so V40's
    # AUTOINCREMENT does not retire it — and silently adopts any entity_links written against it.
    #
    # `notes` defaults to the `''` this always wrote, so no existing caller changes. It is a
    # parameter at all for the create-with-a-body path (`gori run issues create --notes…`,
    # #1019): filed as part of the INSERT, an issue and its body arrive in one transaction,
    # where an insert-then-`update_issue` sequence can land its first half and lose the second.
    # Every surface that files with a body now rides this — the CLI (#1019), the TUI form
    # (#1019, see `Runner#create_issue_from_form`) and MCP `create_issue{notes:}` (#1076) —
    # because one transaction is the only shape where a peer reading the project between the
    # two writes cannot see a titled issue with no body.
