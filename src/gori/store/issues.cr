    # SQLITE_FULL/IOERR, or an unrelated co-submitted write raising — writer_loop batches
    # up to BATCH_MAX ops from every fiber into one transaction). Returning the captured
    # id there handed out the rowid of an issue that does not exist, and because
    # `issues.id` is INTEGER PRIMARY KEY without AUTOINCREMENT the next issue created is
    # handed that same id and silently adopts any entity_links written against it.

    # `title`/`notes` are accepted for the singular's sake only: writing one title (or one
    # notes buffer) across N issues would overwrite each with another's text, so the two
