    # Every `source` the #124 feed carries, as the producers spell it. The column is a free
    # string — `insert_event` takes whatever it is handed — so this is the list of what is
    # actually WRITTEN, and it exists because three surfaces had each grown their own copy of
    # it: the Activity pane's filter cycle (`ACT_SOURCES`), that filter's keybinding help in
    # `verbs/activity.cr` (which had already lost `config`), and the MCP `list_events{source}`
    # schema. All three read this now. A filter offering a source nothing writes returns an
    # empty feed that reads as "nothing happened".
    #
    # Ordered the way a reader wants them: who acted first (`agent`, `config`, `issues`), then
    # the background producers. `script` is a `gori run notify` line for the operator (#1323) —
    # its own word rather than `agent`, because a shell loop is not one.
    #
    # `issues` is the one that proves the list has to live here. `runner/evidence.cr` started
    # writing it (an operator froze a copy of a flow onto an issue) without registering it, and
    # because the column is a free string nothing complained: the rows landed in the feed, the
    # Activity pane's `s` chip could never narrow to them, and MCP `list_events{source:"issues"}`
    # was REFUSED as invalid while naming a set that omitted a source the project writes. A
    # writer that is not in this list is reachable only by reading the whole feed.
    EVENT_SOURCES = %w[agent operator script config issues bindings session rewriter probe discover fuzzer miner sequencer]

    # Every `level` the feed carries, in the order the Activity pane's `l` chip cycles them.
    # Here for the reason EVENT_SOURCES is: the column is a free string and this is the list of
    # what is actually written.
    EVENT_LEVELS = %w[info success warn error]

    # The feed's spelling of a producer's level SYMBOL.
    #
    # The four job controllers (fuzzer, miner, sequencer, discover) each pick a level as a symbol
    # and hand the SAME symbol to the notification centre, whose vocabulary is not this one:
    # `:warning` is a tray level, `warn` is the feed's. Spelling it straight through with
    # `level.to_s` made the Sequencer the one producer of ten writing "warning", which the
    # Activity pane then had to match on TOP of "warn" (`act_level_set`) or its chip would hide
    # half the feed's warnings, and which an MCP reader comparing `level` still sees as two words
    # for one level. Everything else passes through — `:info`, `:success` and `:error` are
    # spelled the same on both sides.

    # The Symbol form, which is what a producer holding a level symbol must call.
    #
    # At the SINK, not at the four call sites. Spelling it per-producer is what let the
    # divergence in the first place — each one reaches for `level.to_s` because it is already
    # handing that symbol to the notification centre — and a fix applied at four call sites is a
    # fix the fifth producer does not get. There is exactly one door into this table, so the
    # vocabulary is decided on the way through it.

    # (flows are the firehose via list_history); this is job-lifecycle, agent-action, and
    # permission-denial events.
    # `actor` defaults to nil — NOT to the ambient surface — and the difference is the whole
    # point of the column. Most producers here are background engines: a binding that missed, a
    # hook that failed, an `Alt-Svc` notice the capture proxy wrote about a client's own
    # request. No surface acted in any of those, and defaulting would file every one of them
    # under whichever process happened to observe it: `tui` in the TUI, `mcp` inside an MCP
    # server, for the same event. That is worse than an empty column, because the actor filter
    # would then return them as the operator's own doing.
    #
    # A surface is claimed only where one demonstrably acted — `ConfigLog.record` (a human or an
    # agent changed a setting) and `log_agent_action` (an agent called a tool), both of which
