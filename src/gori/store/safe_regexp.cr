  # Byte-safe override of SQLite's `REGEXP(pattern, text)` function.
  #
  # crystal-sqlite3 registers a per-connection `regexp` whose body is essentially
  # `Regex.new(pattern).matches?(String.new(text))` — with NO scrub and NO rescue. When
  # the haystack holds non-UTF-8 bytes (a binary request/response body CAST to TEXT for
  # `body~regex`, or any odd byte for a regex Scope rule), Crystal's PCRE2 raises
  # `UTF-8 error: illegal byte`. That exception propagates out of the C callback and
  # aborts the WHOLE query, so a single binary body would make any `body~`/`header~`
  # search (or regex scope lens) silently return nothing.
  #
  # We re-register `regexp` on every pooled connection with a version that scrubs the
  # haystack to valid UTF-8 (invalid sequences → U+FFFD) and rescues any residual error,
  # so a regex scan can never crash and a binary body simply fails to match a text
  # pattern. The scrub is paid only by a haystack that needs it: validity is checked once
  # over SQLite's buffer and a valid one goes to PCRE2 unchanged (see `match_bytes`).
  # Unlike the upstream function (which reads the haystack via `value_text`, a
  # NUL-terminated pointer, and so silently stops scanning at the first embedded NUL),
  # we read the FULL byte length via `value_bytes` so content past a NUL — common in a
  # body that mixes binary and text — is still matched. A pattern that is a plain literal
  # skips PCRE2 altogether (see the literal fast path below) — the same answer, ~10x.

    # each call evicted the other from the one slot, so BOTH recompiled every row
    # (2×rows compiles instead of 2). A small bounded map holds every pattern in the

    # byte measured 1.1ms per 64KB body against PCRE2's 0.22ms, and a captured body is the
    # ATTACKER's to shape. A required last code unit is the same trick that keeps PCRE2 fast
    # there.
    #
    # What `memchr` buys over Horspool's bad-character table is that the stride between
    # candidates stops being a Crystal loop stepping one position at a time: libc's `memchr`
    # is vectorised, so the haystack is walked a word at a time and the loop below runs only
    # where the anchor actually lands. Measured over 100k 1KB bodies
    # (bench/history_filter_bench): `body:zz` 59ms -> 12ms, `body~absentneedle` 43ms -> 12ms,
    # `body:z` 41ms -> 13ms. It buys nothing on `header:`, and that is the honest shape of it:
    # a head is a few hundred bytes and its anchor is usually a letter HTTP heads are full of,
    # so the candidates are dense and there is little stride to vectorise — 27.6ms -> 26.6ms
    # over the same flows (bench/store_bench). The win is the long haystack.
    #
    # A folded ASCII-letter anchor has TWO spellings and therefore two cursors, each advanced
    # only when it was the one consumed — so the two `memchr` walks still cover the haystack
    # once each, not once per candidate. `byte_eq?` accepts exactly those two bytes for such a
    # needle byte and exactly one otherwise (see the note there), so the candidate set is the
    # full one: nothing the verification would have matched is skipped.
    #

    # byte the haystack is made of lands the anchor everywhere and compares the whole needle
    # at each), so the scan carries the same work budget and returns `nil` — hand the row to
    # PCRE2 — rather than grinding. Four passes over the haystack is far more than any
    # realistic needle spends, and it bounds the worst case at roughly 1.5x what PCRE2 alone
    # would have cost instead of 8x.

    # A one-byte needle no longer needs a loop of its own: it is all anchor and no

    # built is nearly the whole cost of a `body~` scan over real captures, so:
    #
    #   · `Utf8.text` builds it: validity decided ONCE, by the `Unicode.valid?` DFA over
    #     SQLite's own buffer (it stops at the first bad byte of a binary body), then either one
    #     copy of a valid haystack or one exact-size scrub of an invalid one;
    #   · PCRE2 is then told not to validate again (NO_UTF_CHECK).
    #
    # The copy of a valid haystack stays because the public `Regex` API takes a String and
    # nothing else — handing SQLite's pointer to PCRE2 would mean reaching into `Regex`'s
    # private `@re`, for a copy that costs about what the match does.
