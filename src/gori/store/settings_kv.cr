    # The Decoder tab's open sub-tabs ({input, chain, name}), as a JSON array. Per PROJECT,
    # not settings.json: a conversion is normally material lifted from THIS project's traffic
    # (send-to-Decoder from History), so it must not follow the operator into the next
    # project. The NAMED chains (`decoder.chains`) stay global — a chain spec is tool config,
    # not engagement data.

    # The Rewriter tab's editable preview sample (the left pane of the live preview pair).

    # The Authorize tab's identities (name + header overlay), as a JSON array. Per PROJECT
    # because a session cookie belongs to one target — carrying it into the next engagement
    # would be both useless and a disclosure. The values are stored in PLAINTEXT, exactly as

    # one settings row for both. The stored KEY STRING deliberately stays
    # `authorize_identities`: an existing project's identities are its slots, and renaming the
    # row would orphan every one of them on upgrade while reporting a clean open.

    # The project's own redaction config (#1035), as a JSON object:

    # the half of a profile that names a TARGET's fields ("this API spells it `pwd_hash`, and
    # the account number lives at `/data/acct`") is engagement data: it is useless in the next
    # engagement and carrying it there would quietly widen what a default export replaces.

    # the two.
