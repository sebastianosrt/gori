  # `events` feed carries it: `source = "operator"`, `kind = "agent_message"`, the text in
  # `message`, the addressing in `payload`. No table of its own — the feed already has the
  # never-reused AUTOINCREMENT cursor every courier needs, the retention sweep, and a reader
  # (`list_events`) on every surface.
  #
  # `target` is `"all"` or `"pid:<n>"`, where `<n>` is the pid of the `gori mcp` PROCESS
  # (`AgentPresence::Entry#pid` for a kind-`mcp` entry) — the one thing the TUI can name and
  # the one thing the courier inside that process knows about itself. Not the agent's own
  # pid: the TUI never sees it, and it differs per client.
  #
  # A message that CLOSES an `ask_operator` question (#1324) carries `in_reply_to` (the
  # question's feed id), `outcome` (`AgentQuestion::OUTCOMES`) and the question's own line, so
  # every route that carries a message frames it as the answer it is — the socket and the
  # tool-result carry see only this row, never the question. `text` is then the chosen label,
  # or a placeholder for a dismissal or an expiry.
