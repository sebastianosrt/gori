    # --- Fuzzer / Intruder (V16) ---------------------------------------------
    # Writes go through exec_task (writer fiber). Own commits bump data_version on
    # the read pool (see data_version docs); live TUI paths must soft-sync, not
    # full-restore session UI on every poll.

    # The template is an operator's REQUEST — captured wire bytes seeded by `^F`, so it can
    # hold a NUL (a gRPC/protobuf frame, a gzip'd POST, a multipart PNG). The column is TEXT
    # storage and the driver reads TEXT through a NUL-TERMINATED pointer, so `rs.read(String)`
    # truncated it at the first 0x00 while the write side bound the full bytesize — the bytes
    # were on disk and the read threw them away. Measured: 73 bytes in, 58 out.
    #
    # Same fix, same reason as `RepeaterSessions::REQUEST_COL`, whose column was migrated for
    # exactly this in V2; the Fuzzer was the last workbench still on the broken shape. CAST is
    # a documented no-op on an already-BLOB value, so this is safe on every existing row.

    # Cascades `entity_links`, for `delete_repeater`'s reason (repeater_sessions.cr states it
    # in full): `fuzz_sessions.id` is `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY` WITHOUT AUTOINCREMENT, and closing
    # a sub-tab (^W) deletes at the TOP of the id space, so the very next ^N is handed the id
    # that just went. A link left behind therefore does not settle at `fuzz #1 (gone)` — it
    # re-binds, `stale: false`, to a session against a DIFFERENT target, and an issue's
    # evidence confidently names traffic the operator never linked (links overlay, exports,
    # MCP `list_links`). Losing the pointer is strictly better than a pointer that starts lying.
    #
    # Both statements in ONE exec_task: the writer batches ops into a single transaction, so a
    # rollback that spares the link row while the session goes is exactly the stranded state
    # this exists to prevent. Matched on ref_kind AND ref_id — session ids collide across
    # kinds (every workbench table starts at 1), so ref_id alone would take a live miner/flow
    # ref with it.
    # Deletes a session AND everything hanging off it: `fuzz_runs.session_id` → `fuzz_results.run_id`.
    # Without the cascade, closing a Fuzzer tab removed the session row and left every run and
    # every result behind — and `fuzz_results` holds `request`, `response_head` and `response_body`,
    # which is the dominant byte cost of a fuzzing project (it is why the compress popup lists
    # "Fuzzer responses" as its own category). Nothing else could ever reach them: the retention
    # sweep only walks flows/ws/h2, and every read here filters by `session_id`, so the rows were
    # invisible in the UI as well as unbounded. Measured on three tiny results — 16.5 kB kept for a
    # session that no longer existed; a real sweep is thousands of results with real bodies.
    #
    # The second pair of statements reaps rows ALREADY stranded by an older build, so a project
    # heals the next time a tab is closed rather than needing a compact. `fuzz_sessions.id` is
    # AUTOINCREMENT (V10), so a dangling `session_id` can never be re-pointed at a new session —
    # this is a space leak, not the evidence-contamination class.
    #
    # Returns true only when the session row was deleted and the transaction committed. An
    # active child run refuses the whole operation: closing a tab must not remove the parent
    # underneath a writer that is still appending result batches. The check and deletes share
    # the writer transaction, so a second Store cannot insert a run into the gap.
