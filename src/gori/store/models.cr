      # Did this flow OPEN a WebSocket? The one place that answers it, across both transports
      # gori captures a socket over (#742).
      #
      # ## Why this exists
      #
      # Every surface used to ask `row.status == 101` — History's MESSAGES pane, the TUI /
      # CLI / MCP repeater seeds, `gori run show`, MCP `get_flow`, the HAR writer, and the HAR
      # reader on the way back in. Nine copies of one rule, and `Export::Har`'s said out loud
      # that it was copied ("the 101 status is how every other surface asks … so it is asked
      # the same way here"). Then #733 landed WebSocket capture over RFC 8441 extended CONNECT
      # — `CONNECT /path HTTP/2` answered `200`, never `101` — and all nine drifted at once:
      # the frames were decoded and written to `ws_messages`, and not one reader could see
      # them.
      #
      # ## What it is NOT
      #
      # It is not "does gori hold a transcript for this flow". That question is answered by
      # the rows themselves — `Store#ws_messages(id)` returns an empty array for anything that
      # is not a socket — and every DISPLAY surface asks it that way, holding no predicate at
      # all. This one is for the two callers that must answer before (or without) reading the
      # rows: `Export::Har.skip_reason`, which has to tell "a socket whose transcript we do
      # not have" apart from "an ordinary HTTP flow", and `gori run repeater <flow-id>`, which
      # refuses a one-shot replay of a socket.
      #
      # It is also not "can the Repeater re-establish this socket" — that is
      # `Repeater::WsEngine.replayable?`, which asks about the REQUEST alone. The two differ in
      # both directions: this one additionally requires the origin to have ANSWERED (101 / 2xx),
      # while `replayable?` says yes to a handshake that was refused, because a refused
      # handshake is still one gori can put back on the wire.
      #
      # ## The two shapes
      #
      # * HTTP/1.1 (RFC 6455): a request carrying `Upgrade: websocket` that was ANSWERED 101.
      #   The status is required — a handshake the origin rejected with a 403 is an ordinary
      #   failed request, and HAR must keep exporting it as one.
      # * HTTP/2 (RFC 8441 §5.1): an extended CONNECT whose `:protocol` is `websocket`,
      #   answered 2xx. `HeadCodec` filters every pseudo-header out of the stored head and
      #   re-adds this one as `X-Gori-Protocol`, so the marker line IS the `:protocol`
      #   pseudo-header; a peer field of the same name is renamed away by the same codec, and
      #   the rewrite path passes no protocol at all, so the line cannot be forged from the
      #   wire on an h2 head. 2xx is required for the same reason 101 is: before the origin
      #   answers there is no socket, and a refusal never opens one.

    # exact header text: `AddHeader` appends a `Name: value` line, `SetHeader` replaces
    # an existing header's value (or appends when absent), `RemoveHeader` drops every
    # matching header line. Header ops carry the header NAME in `pattern` and the value
    # in `replacement` (empty for `RemoveHeader`). Stored lowercase; default `replace`
    # so every pre-op rule keeps its exact meaning.
    #
    # `Pipe` (#818) is the second odd one: it does not carry its replacement, it COMPUTES it.
    # `pattern` selects the region exactly as `Replace` does (literal or regex, per
    # `match_kind`), and `replacement` holds an ARGV — the operator's own command, exec'd with
    # no shell, fed the matched bytes on stdin, its stdout taken as the replacement
    # (`Gori::ProcessHook`). It is the one op whose effect is not derivable from the row, which
    # is why every surface renders it as `pipe` rather than as a replacement string, and why a
    # peer creating one gets a louder announcement than a peer creating any other rule
    # (`PeerNotices`).
    #
    # `ShortCircuit` (#511) is the odd one out and deliberately so: the other four REWRITE a
    # message that already exists, this one ANSWERS the request and `Upstream.dial` is never
    # reached. It carries the request match in `pattern` (literal or regex, like `Replace`)
    # and the canned response in `replacement` — a raw response head, optionally a blank line
    # and an inline body — with `body_file` as the alternative body source. It is always

    # field a `FlowRow` can answer, and `Colormarker` still answers those in memory with no query
    # at all. It was wrong about the rest: for `body:`/`header:`/`size:`/`dur:` there IS a query
    # to run, it is bounded by the screenful of ids being painted, and the price of not running
    # it was `body:` parsing fine and painting nothing. See `Colormarker`'s class header for the
    # tier split.

    # No `host` field, unlike `MatchRule` and `ExtractRule`: `host:` inside the filter is the
