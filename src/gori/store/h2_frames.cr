      # `h2_frames WHERE conn_id IN (SELECT id FROM h2_connections WHERE <stale>)`, and there is
      # no `h2_connections` row with id 0 for it to select. Measured: 6 such frames survived a
      # sweep that took the flow table from 20 rows to 2, and they stay for the life of the file
      # (only `compact --h2-frames`, which drops the whole log, gets rid of them).
      #
      # 0 arrives two ways, and both mean "do not log": `FlowSink#on_h2_open`'s default returns
      # it for a sink that keeps no frame log, and `StoreSink#on_h2_open` returns it when
      # `insert_h2_connection` did not commit. Guarded here rather than in the sink so every
      # caller is covered by one rule — the sink's two siblings, `on_response` and
      # `on_ws_message`, already refuse a non-positive parent id for the same reason.
