    # uncaptured are asked again — one indexed probe each (`idx_flows_sitemap` leads with host),
    # not the aggregate. A DELETE can take a flag the other way (the last flow on an origin
    # gone), and the only honest answer to that is the aggregate again: flow ids are never
    # reused (V39), so rows were deleted exactly when the count grew by less than the newest id
    # did, or the newest id itself went DOWN (the newest flow deleted: both fall by one) —
    # which holds for a peer's delete too, where no in-process counter would.
