    # The durable half of an out-of-band active check: a payload gori planted in a target and
    # the finding it promotes to if that payload ever calls home. See the V12 migration comment
    # for why this state has to outlive the scan that created it.

    # How many outstanding probes one sweep considers. Outstanding means "sent, never called
    # back", which for a real assessment is tens of rows — but a project that probed a large
    # surface with no listener behind it accumulates them without bound, and the sweep runs on a
    # timer. Newest-first so the cap drops the OLDEST unanswered probes, which are also the ones
    # least likely to still be live (a callback usually lands within seconds).
    PROBE_OAST_PENDING_CAP = 1000
