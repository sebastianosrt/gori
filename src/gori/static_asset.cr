module Gori
  # What counts as a STATIC ASSET — the images, fonts and audio/video a browsed app pulls in by
  # the dozen beside every API call (#1239). One classifier behind the QL `static:` field, and
  # through it behind the TUI's hide-static lens, `gori run history|sitemap --hide-static` and
  # MCP `hide_static`. It runs ONCE per flow, when the response is written, into the `static_asset`
  # column (schema V31) every surface then reads, so there is no second list to drift and no
  # per-row function call on a list that reloads during live capture.
  #
  # Deliberately narrow, and in the same direction Discover's `BINARY_EXT` is: a flow is hidden
  # only when it cannot plausibly be where the finding is. Everything that can carry an endpoint,
  # a secret or script stays visible:
  #
  #   · SVG — XML, and it can carry `<script>` and `href`s.
  #   · JS and source maps — endpoints, keys, the app's own source.
  #   · CSS — `url(…)` names endpoints, and it is the target of CSS injection.
  #   · JSON, PDF, archives, `wasm`, `octet-stream` — an exposed `backup.zip` IS the finding.
  #   · HLS/M3U playlists (`audio/mpegurl`) — a list of URLs under a media type.
  #   · An image fetched THROUGH a URL parameter (`/_next/image?url=…`) — an image proxy is a
  #     server-side fetch, the classic SSRF surface, however ordinary its response looks.
  #
  # And only a SUCCESSFUL fetch is static. An error on a path that should be a plain file says
  # something about what is serving it, a redirect on one is as telling, and `status = 0` is
  # gori's own "no response" (an aborted intercept, an upstream failure) — hiding one of those
  # would hide the one row the operator acted on.
