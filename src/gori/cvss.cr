  # CVSS parsing, scoring, and severity resolution for Issues (#575).
  # Wraps hahwul/cvss.cr to handle both vector strings (v1..v4) and numeric scores.
  module Cvss
    # Everything derivable from one CVSS string, from ONE parse:
    # {score, severity, canonical form, was it a vector?}. Returns nil if the input is blank
    # or scores as nothing.
    #
    # One entry point because `::CVSS.parse?` is `rescue`-based — a bare score like `"9.8"`
    # runs the parser to a raise and unwinds it, TWICE (the plain string and the `upcase`
    # retry) — and the callers ask several questions about the same value. `Store::Issue`
    # asks at construction and keeps the answers; a per-question helper meant the Issues
    # list re-ran that pair for every visible row on every repaint and `cvss:` re-ran it for
    # every issue on every keystroke in the filter bar.
    #
    # The fourth member is what separates `"8.8"` from a vector, which Markdown export needs
    # and which no amount of squinting at the canonical string answers (`"8.8"` canonicalises
    # to itself).

    # Two operators filing the same finding must not leave two different byte strings in the
    # column — one typing the lowercase form a scanner emitted and one the uppercase — because
    # every export prints the string verbatim and anything downstream keyed on it then sees
    # two values for one vector. `resolve` computed this from the start and every caller threw
    # it away; `Store#insert_issue`/`#update_issues` apply it now, at the one point no write

    # That is the coupling this repo kills on sight: a member added to either enum
    # re-numbers the other's bands with no compiler help and no visible failure, just
    # issues filed one band off. As an exhaustive `case … in` the same edit stops the build.
