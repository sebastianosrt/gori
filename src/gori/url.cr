  # How a request TARGET is written down when a surface has to say WHERE a message went.
  #
  # There is exactly one rule and it has now been written four times: a plaintext
  # forward-proxy request is captured in ABSOLUTE form (`http://host:port/path` — the wire
  # truth, P7) while a CONNECT-tunnelled or HTTP/2 request is captured origin-form (`/path`),
  # so a surface that glues the host onto every target doubles the authority on half of them.
  # `Store::FlowRow.absolute_form?` had the careful version, `Tui::Url.origin_path` had a
  # second, `CLI::Output.flow_row_text` and `Links.flow_location` each had a
  # `target.starts_with?("http")` third — which is not the same predicate: it misses the
  # case-insensitivity RFC 3986 §3.1 requires, so a captured `GET HTTP://host/x` printed as
  # `127.0.0.1HTTP://127.0.0.1:19594/upper`, exactly the doubling `absolute_form?`'s own
  # comment says it exists to prevent.
  #
  # Byte-level and Regex-free for the reason `absolute_form?` states: a target is bytes an
  # operator or a peer put on the wire and need not be valid UTF-8, and PCRE2 RAISES on an
  # invalid byte rather than not matching.

    # arrives ORIGIN-form and used to build a port-FREE string, so the identical rule silently
    # skipped it and the excluded TLS port was forwarded. The failure direction was permissive.
    #
    # Omitting `port` keeps the BYTE-IDENTICAL port-free spelling — no authority normalisation
    # either — because that arm is `Scope.request_url`, the url a scope INCLUDE and
