  # The Match&Replace lens (the "Rewriter" tab): rewrites of request/response messages
  # applied in flight. A rule either REPLACES text (literal substring or regex with
  # $1/\1 capture groups) in the HEAD (request/status line + headers) or BODY (the
  # entity), or performs a header operation by NAME (add / set / remove). Rules can be
  # scoped to a host glob. Human-configured (P4).
  #
  # A rule is persisted in one of TWO places, and which one is part of its identity
  # (`Store::RuleScope`): a PROJECT rule is a `match_rules` row, a GLOBAL rule lives in
  # settings.json and applies in every project. `Rules.merged` folds both into the one ordered
  # list everything below this line reads — globals first, then the project's own — so no
  # rewrite path, preview or count has to know a rule's scope at all. Only the editing half
  # does, which is why every mutator takes the {id, scope} PAIR: the two stores number their
  # rules independently, so an id alone names two different rules.
  #
  # Global-first is the standing-policy-then-local-layer order `Env.effective_vars` and
  # `Probe.custom_rules` already use: a global rule is what the operator wants on every
  # engagement, a project rule refines the traffic in front of them today.
  #
  # One instance is SHARED between the proxy fibers (which call `rewrite_*` on every
  # message) and the TUI (which edits the rule set). A Mutex guards the rule snapshot so
  # an edit can never tear a concurrent rewrite.

    # yet" and "there IS a value and the head cannot carry it" — and they used to share one
    # `nil`. `report_unbound` only ever understood the first: it computes
    # `Env.unbound(rule.replacement)` and returns when that is empty, and a BOUND name is by
    # definition not unbound. So the boundary refusal fired in total silence — no header on the
    # wire, no event, no log line, no advisory, no status — and every head-scoped injection rule
    # in the project simply ceased to exist the moment an origin minted a cookie with a stray

    # have side effects. Such a rule is skipped instead (its region passes through) and the
    # pane says so. The default is TRUE, because the other caller — `mcp/tools/send.cr` — is a
    # real send, where the rule has to do what it says it does.

    # true of the pane, and false of the other caller. So an MCP `send_request{apply_rules:
    # true}` whose `SetHeader $SESSION` rule was blocked on an unbound name (or on a bound one
    # carrying a CR, `Refusal::Boundary`) injected nothing, said nothing, and answered with the
    # origin's reply to a request the rule never touched — while the SAME rule on the proxy
    # path writes the row that names it. `run_hooks` already answers "is this a real send"
    # (its own doc says so), and the two questions it now drives — may this fork a process, may
    # this write a row — have the same answer for both callers; a third caller that wants one
    # without the other still says so.
    #
    # `report_refused`'s throttle is per {rule, binding revision} on THIS `Rules` INSTANCE, so
    # what it bounds depends on who holds the instance. The proxy holds one for the life of the
    # project and writes one row per refused rule per rebind; `mcp/tools/send.cr` builds a fresh
    # `Rules.load(store)` per call (it wants the current rule set), so an agent looping
    # `send_request{apply_rules: true}` against a rule that stays refused writes one row per
    # send. That is the honest reading of an explicitly requested send — each one really did go

    #   * `$$` resolves LAST in meaning: `$$SESSION` is the literal text `$SESSION`, not the
    #     bound value. That is the only way an operator can write a literal `$NAME` at all.
    #     (New for the literal-replace and header ops, which previously had no escape
    #     because they had nothing to escape from.)
    #   * A binding value is **server-controlled**, and for `MatchKind::Regex` the
    #     replacement is interpreted by `gsub`: Crystal reads `\1`, `\0` and `\k<name>` in a
    #     replacement string, so a token containing `\1` would splice a capture group into
    #     the wire bytes and one containing `\k<x>` raises. `escape_backrefs` doubles every
    #     backslash in a substituted value before it lands there. `$` needs no escaping —
    #     Crystal's replacement grammar does not read it — and the literal-replace and the
    #     three header ops interpret nothing at all, so they take the value verbatim.
