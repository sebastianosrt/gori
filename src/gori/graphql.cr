    # Which of the shapes a real GraphQL API exposes this request is in. Only two of them
    # were ever recognised — a POST JSON object with a `query`, and a GET `?query=` — so a
    # batched array, a persisted query, a multipart upload mutation and a raw
    # `application/graphql` document got NO decoded pane, no variables pretty-print and no
    # projection anywhere, which is precisely the set of shapes that carry the interesting
    # attacks (batching abuse / rate-limit bypass, persisted-query allowlist bypass, upload
    # mutations, content-type confusion).
    #
    # `Urlencoded` joined them late for the same reason: a `query=…&variables=…` body is what
    # express-graphql and Yoga accept alongside JSON, and it is the first thing reached for
    # when a JSON content-type is filtered — so the shape most likely to be a bypass attempt
    # was the shape gori showed as an ordinary form POST.
    #
    # The distinction is not cosmetic: it decides whether the Repeater may RE-ENCODE the
    # request from the edited pane, and each shape needs its OWN inverse. Json, Query and
    # Urlencoded round-trip an operationName + query + variables triple through three named
    # slots. Batch round-trips that same triple per indexed element back into the JSON array.
    # Document needs no inverse at all — the pane IS the body. Persisted has no document to
    # write back, so its pane is the JSON ENVELOPE itself and the inverse just re-minifies it,
    # which is how the extensions/persistedQuery block becomes editable without gori inventing
    # a `query` the client never sent.
    #
    # Multipart is the one parsed shape left display-only: the pane shows the `operations`
    # part of a body whose other parts (`map`, the file blobs, the boundaries) are not in it,
    # so writing the pane back would have to reconstruct bytes it never saw. See `editable?`.
