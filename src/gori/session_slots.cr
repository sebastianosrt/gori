  # The project's session slots, plus WHICH ONE is active.
  #
  # A slot is a named send context: a header overlay plus a namespace for the values
  # `Bindings` observes (see `SessionSlot`). This class owns the persisted list — one settings
  # row, the same one the Authorize tab has always written — and the ACTIVE pointer, which is
  # the only piece of session state a send seam has to consult.
  #
  # ## Why the active slot is in memory and the list is on disk
  #
  # The list is configuration: header names, header values an operator typed, and which
  # extract rules belong to which identity. Configuration persists, exactly as `env.vars` and
  # the Rewriter's rules do.
  #
  # The active pointer does NOT, and it is the same argument `Bindings` makes about a value:
  # a slot with nothing bound in it is a slot that resolves nothing, and every binding table
  # is empty at process start by design. Restoring "admin is active" into an empty admin
  # table would hand the next send an overlay whose `$SESSION` is literal — a 401 the operator
  # did not ask for and cannot see the cause of. Activation is one keystroke and one line of
  # `gori run`; a stale one is a support ticket.
  #
  # ## What is NOT here
  #
  # No cookie jar. A slot carries the headers the operator wrote and the bindings gori
  # observed; it does not parse `Set-Cookie`, keep a path/domain tree, or expire anything.
  # RFC 6265 storage is a separate feature with its own failure modes, and the case operators
  # actually ask for — "send these headers as this identity" — is this one.
  #
  # No auto-login. `--bind-from` already replays ONE named flow to fill a binding table, and
  # that is a flow the operator pointed at. A macro that decides for itself when to
  # re-authenticate is gori acting behind the operator's back (P4).
  class SessionSlots

    # surfaces, until an operator noticed and renamed one by hand. The rule lives here for the

    # nothing"); the cost of under-pruning is a discarded identity's live credential going out
    # in an authorization test.

    # The row is the ONLY signal here, and that bounds what this catches: a re-add whose
    # persisted definition is byte-identical to what this process last read is indistinguishable
    # from no write at all. Closing that would need a persisted per-slot id, which the blob
    # deliberately does not carry (an old build has to read it — see `SessionSlot.serialize`).

    # `save` takes a whole list, which is what the TUI's identities card hands it (the card
    # holds the array and edits it in place). A surface that names ONE slot — `gori run
    # session add`, MCP `create_session_slot` — would otherwise each rebuild the list and each
    # re-decide what "exactly one baseline" means, and three copies of that rule is how the
    # Authorize tab and a headless run come to disagree about which slot a run is judged
    # against. So the rule lives here, once.
    #
    # All four return `save`'s answer: false means the project was NOT written. They do NOT
    # answer "no such slot" / "that name is taken" — a caller that needs to tell those apart
    # from a busy store asks `find` first, the same split `HostOverrides` makes for the same
    # reason (a deterministic refusal reported as retryable makes an agent loop).

    # this whole class is built on (`find`, `activate`, and `Bindings`' per-slot tables are
    # all keyed by NAME and nothing else), so the caller's definition REPLACES that row in
