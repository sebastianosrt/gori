    # main file's mtime does not move until a CHECKPOINT — which happens when the last
    # connection closes. Reading only the db file therefore reports "last active" as the
    # moment the project was CREATED for the entire time it is open: the Project tab drew
    # `Activity` older than `Created`, and every peer reading a live project (MCP
    # `list_projects`, `gori run project list`, a second TUI's picker) saw the same stale
    # value. `Store.captured_flows` already guards the OPPOSITE direction (a read-only
    # census's close checkpoints and would stamp a project "just active", so it puts the
    # mtime back); this is the direction that was never covered.

    # `File.info?` + rescue, not `File.exists?` then `File.info`: that pair is a TOCTOU
    # window a PEER closes routinely — `ProjectRegistry#delete` and MCP `delete_project`
    # `rm_rf` the workspace, so the file can vanish between the two calls and `File.info`
    # raises `File::NotFoundError` out of `ProjectRegistry#list`'s `sort_by!`, the picker's
    # row render and MCP `list_projects`. `File.info?` closes the vanish case; the rescue
    # covers the one it does not (an unreadable parent raises `File::AccessDeniedError`).
