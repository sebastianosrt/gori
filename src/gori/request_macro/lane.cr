  # The gate every candidate passes through: it decides WHEN the steps run, what a candidate does
  # while they are running, and what a failure costs. One lane per run, shared by every worker
  # fiber.
  #
  # ## Epochs
  #
  # `cadence.every == N` means the value a run of the steps leaves is used by the next N
  # candidates, and those N are an EPOCH. The first candidate to arrive with no epoch open runs
  # the steps; the N-1 after it share the value; the candidate after that opens the next epoch.
  # An epoch is a barrier in one direction: the steps of epoch k+1 do not start until every
  # candidate of epoch k has finished. Without that, a slow candidate of epoch k could pick up
  # epoch k+1's value at its send, and "N candidates share a value" would be a hope rather than
  # a guarantee.
  #
  # So the parallelism the macro leaves a run is exactly `min(concurrency, N)`, and for
  # `every == 1` — a fresh value for EVERY candidate — it is one: a one-time token cannot be
  # shared by two workers without changing the test, and the barrier is what makes that true
  # instead of merely likely. The plan reports it (`Info#concurrency`) so nobody discovers it
  # from a stopwatch.
  #
  # Candidates are counted in the order they REACH the gate. With one worker that is the
  # generation order; with several it is the order the workers' fibers get there, which is
  # dispatch order in practice and is not promised any tighter than the scheduler promises.
  #
  # ## Failure
  #
  # A failed run of the steps opens no epoch. The candidate that asked for it is refused
  # (`Entry#refused?`, its row an error row), and the next candidate tries again, so a flaky
  # login costs the candidates it failed for and not the N after them. `OnFailure::Stop` ends
  # the run on the first failure; `Skip` ends it after `FAILURE_LIMIT` in a row, so a login that
  # is simply broken is not hammered once per payload — the lockout the same limit in #1233
  # exists to prevent. Ending the run is the ENGINE's act (`aborted?`): the lane only says so.
