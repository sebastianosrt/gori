module Gori::RequestMacro
  # The `Source` that sends the macro's Repeater sessions.
  #
  # A step is a saved session replayed the way a Repeater tab sends it — the same
  # `Repeater::Plan`, so `$NAME` expansion, the auto Content-Length, SNI, TLS preset and the
  # tab's protocol are all the tab's — and, being a deliberate single send, it runs the
  # binding table's extract rules over its response (`Repeater::Sender#extract`). That is the
  # whole extraction story: a CSRF rule written for the Repeater already works, with nothing
  # macro-specific to configure.
  #
  # ## Who the steps are sent as
  #
  # As the slot that is ACTIVE for the run, overlay included — the opposite of #1233's refresh
  # steps. A refresh replaces a credential, so its login request must not carry the stale one;
  # a macro fetches a page that needs the session the candidates are sent as, and a CSRF form
  # served to an anonymous client carries the anonymous client's token. It also means the
  # rebind lands in the table the candidates resolve from: both read the active slot.
  #
  # ## Gates
  #
  # Every step passes the surface's Layer 1 (`Outbound#check_request`, at build and again per
  # run, so a scope edited mid-run stops the next step) and Layer 2 (`Outbound#sweep_block`,
  # Sandbox AND explicit excludes). It is `sweep_block` and not the Repeater's `send_block`
  # because this is an automated sweep's traffic: an operator's carve-out holds for it, exactly
  # as it does for the candidates. Steps are also charged to the run's request budget and held
  # to its rate, so `max_requests` and `--rate` mean what they say with a macro switched on.
  #
  # ## What a step may not be
  #
  # A session that still holds live `§…§` markers (the tab would render them, this would not),
  # a WebSocket handshake (a step is one request and one response), or one the plan cannot
  # build. All refused at build time, before anything is sent, with the step named.
