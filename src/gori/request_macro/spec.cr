module Gori
  # Request-time macros (#1350): a short list of saved Repeater sessions a Fuzzer or Miner run
  # replays BEFORE a candidate request, so the value they leave in the session bindings — a form
  # CSRF token, a one-time nonce — is fresh when the candidate resolves its `$BIND.NAME`.
  #
  # #1233 refreshes a session SLOT when its bound credential is about to expire (`jwt-exp`, a
  # `ttl`). That is the wrong clock for a value the application rotates on every page load: it
  # is invalidated long before its session expires, and a sweep whose second candidate carries
  # the first response's token collects a page of 403s that read as "the payloads were tried".
  # This is the same actor on a different clock, counted in candidates rather than in seconds.
  #
  # The macro itself adds no mechanism to the engines. Extraction is the existing extract rules
  # (`TokenExtract`, `Bindings#observe`), injection is the existing `$BIND.NAME` resolved at send
  # time (`Fuzz::Sender#send`), and every step goes through `Repeater::Plan` and the surface's
  # own `Outbound`. What is new is only WHEN the steps run, and what happens around a run that
  # fails — see `Lane`.
  #
  # This file is the configuration and nothing else. It is a leaf on purpose: it rides on
  # `Fuzz::Config` and `Miner::Config`, which every surface already builds, so a surface's whole
  # job is to parse ITS input format into a `Spec` (DESIGN.md §2) and `Plan.build` does the rest.
  module RequestMacro
    # Prefix on the `error` of a candidate the macro refused to send. One spelling, matched by
    # `failed?`, so the engines can tell "the macro failed" from a network error: a retry cannot
    # repair it (the macro would only fail again, and re-run its steps against the login
    # endpoint), and a surface must not read it as the target's answer.
    ERROR_PREFIX = "macro: "

    # A candidate that was waiting at the gate when the operator stopped the run. Nothing was
    # sent, so it is not a failure and not a tested name — the Fuzzer drops the row, and the
    # Miner must not count it either.
    STOPPED_UNSENT = "#{ERROR_PREFIX}the run was stopped before this candidate was sent"

    # A macro this run cannot honour. A `Gori::Error` and deliberately NOT a `PlanError::Reason`:
    # that enum is `case … in` in three surfaces' exhaustive matches, and this refusal has no
    # surface idiom to write — the sentence names Repeater sessions and extract rules, which read
    # the same on every surface. `Fuzz::ChainError` is the precedent; every surface's existing
    # `Gori::Error` path carries the message unchanged.

    #   * `off`      — never; the configured steps are kept but not run.
    #   * `request`  — before every candidate (`every == 1`).
    #   * `N`        — before the first candidate, then again once N candidates have used its
    #                  value (`every == N`).
    #
    # There is no separate "once before the first candidate" spelling: the first candidate always
    # opens an epoch, so `every N` with N larger than the run IS "once, up front". See `Lane`
    # for what an epoch is and what it guarantees.

    # (`Runner.build`), and the resolved requests are frozen for the run — an edit to the tab
    # halfway through a sweep must not change the test, and a tab deleted halfway through must
    # not end it.

    # succeeds when ANY binding this run can see was rebound, which is enough to catch "the
    # extract rule never fired" and not enough to catch "a session cookie rotated on the page
    # but the CSRF rule missed" — the stale-token case this feature exists to remove.
