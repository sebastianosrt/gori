module Gori
  # The boolean grammar shared by every filter surface — History QL, Intercept catch
  # rules, Repeater sub-tabs, Issues and Probe. It owns ONLY the shape of a query
  # (how tokens are cut, grouped and combined); what a single token MEANS stays with
  # each backend, because they legitimately differ (QL compiles to SQL and drops a bad
  # numeric term, Probe keeps a half-typed `-host:` matching everything so the list
  # doesn't blank out mid-keystroke). Backends fold a parsed tree into their own
  # representation with `build`.
  #
  #   host:acme status:>=500          AND is implicit (whitespace)
  #   host:a AND host:b               ...and also spellable, since typing AND and
  #                                   having it silently free-text was a trap
  #   host:a OR host:b                OR
  #   (host:a OR host:b) -method:GET  parentheses group; `-` negates one term
  #   NOT (host:cdn OR host:static)   NOT negates a term OR a whole group
  #   -(host:cdn OR host:static)      ...and so do `-(` and `NOT(` fused to the paren
  #   host:"my host"  "two words"     quotes keep spaces inside one token
  #
  # `AND`/`OR`/`NOT` are recognised UPPERCASE-only and unquoted, so the far more
  # common case of searching for the words "and"/"or"/"not" still works; quote them
  # ("AND") to force a literal even in caps. Precedence is NOT > AND > OR.

    # One `field:value` / `field~value` / bare-word predicate — the leaf every backend
    # parses for itself. `text` is normalised for matching (quotes and the leading `-`
    # removed); `source` is the chunk exactly as typed, which diagnostics echo back
    # (QL's `analyze`) and Tab-completion splices over.
    #
    # `negate` rides on the LEAF rather than becoming a NotNode because the backends
    # disagree about negating an EMPTY value — `-host:` filters nothing in Probe but
    # matches nothing in Issues — and that difference is deliberate and spec-pinned in
    # both. A NotNode wrapper would silently unify them. `NOT term` desugars onto this

    # plain — the colour tells you how the query will really be read.
    #

    # (whitespace between terms is skipped); callers fill gaps with their base colour.
    #
    # `seps` is which characters this BACKEND accepts as a field separator, and it is
    # not decoration: only QL implements the `~` regex operator, so painting `title~x`
    # as a field in the Issues bar would advertise a match that backend will never
    # perform (it free-texts the whole token instead). Structure is shared; the operator
    # set is not, so the caller states it. See `SEPS_FIELD` / `SEPS_FIELD_REGEX`.

    # bar painting an operator it does not run; this stops one painting a FIELD it does not have.
    # `hsot:acme` is a typo whose whole token gets free-texted — it matches nothing real — and
    # every bar rendered it in the same confident blue as `host:acme`, so the one visible signal
    # said the query was fine. Naming a namespace made it worse: `resp.status:200` is a reasonable
    # guess at a real prefix, and QL now DROPS it, while the bar still called it a field.
    #
    # The separator is passed because a field can be real under `:` and not under `~`: QL takes
    # `status:5xx` and has no `status~` at all, and painting `status~5..` as a field claimed a
    # regex match nobody performs (the term is dropped). One predicate, two operators, one truth.
