  # The token-randomness analyzer ("Sequencer"): collects a large sample of a
  # security token (session cookie, CSRF token, reset token, API key) and grades
  # its predictability with entropy + statistical randomness tests — the gori
  # counterpart of Burp Sequencer / the Caido Sequencer plugin.
  #
  # Two collection modes over one event stream: LIVE REPLAY sends ONE fixed request
  # N times and pulls a token out of each response; MANUAL analyzes a pasted set of
  # tokens without touching the network. Headless and self-contained: it depends
  # only on the reused Fuzz::Sender/Backend send seam and the body decoder, never on
  # Store or the TUI — so the one engine drives the TUI Sequencer tab, `gori run
  # sequence`, and the MCP sequence_* tools.
