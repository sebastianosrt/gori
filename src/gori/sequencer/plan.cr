  #
  # The builder never writes the user-facing sentence: every surface phrases these in its
  # own idiom (`gori run sequence: token location selector is empty` vs the TUI's `set a
  # token location first`), and those strings are part of each surface's contract. So
  # `reason` is the machine-readable fact and the `message` here is only a fallback for a
  # caller that has nothing better to say.

      # was left blank, so every response would miss and the run would only burn requests.

  # the engine) belongs to `Plan.build`.

      # VERDICT about a token, and every one of the `--count` samples is the same captured
      # request re-sent. Substituting a `$id` in that capture makes the entropy report a
      # statement about a request the operator never captured — measured at 5 tainted sends
      # out of 6 on `gori run sequence <flow> --bind-from <flow>`.

      # one of `--count` samples (default 500) is the SAME captured request re-sent, to the
      # same origin, at a default concurrency of 1 — so it was paying 500 sequential TCP +
      # TLS handshakes to collect 500 tokens. `idle_conns` is the concurrency because that is
      # the most sockets that can be checked out at once (see `Fuzz::Sender#initialize`).

      # Safe for the verdict this tool produces: `ConnPool` refuses to park a socket whose
      # request or response was not cleanly framed, so a reused connection carries the same
      # bytes a fresh one would. `Engine#orchestrate` closes the backend, which is what
      # releases the parked sockets.
      #
      # h2 is no longer the exception it used to be: since `Repeater::H2Pool` an h2 sequence
      # reuses a connection too (serially — stream 1, then 3, then 5). That is the same
      # trade this knob has always made on HTTP/1.1, not a new one, and it lands on the same
      # escape hatch: an origin whose session issuance is CONNECTION-bound would have its
      # entropy verdict shaped by socket reuse, so `--no-keep-alive` is there to re-take the
      # sample over fresh connections and compare. Worth knowing on h2 specifically, because
