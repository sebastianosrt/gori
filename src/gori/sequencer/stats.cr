  # tokens and returns a Report: entropy figures, a per-test verdict table, an overall
  # rating, and raw arrays for the DIST-style charts (no baked color — the view resolves
  # theme at draw time). p-values come from Math.erfc (normal tail) and a Wilson–Hilferty
  # chi-square approximation, so the whole module is closed-form and deterministic.

    # would push that higher. Splitting α across the family holds the family-wise false-alarm
    # rate at the ~1% a single test carried, which is what makes the family safe to grow.
    # Real weakness is unaffected: a broken generator's p-values are ~0, orders below either

    # a biased draw from the same one, so it is structure and is judged by what it holds — its
    # own entropy, credited in `analyze` — rather than pooled with the columns it does not
    # resemble.
    #
    # "Far fewer" is measured against what uniform draws would show: n draws from a k-symbol
    # alphabet reveal k(1 - (1 - 1/k)^n) distinct values on average, and a column showing at
    # most half of that is flagged. Chance does not get there: the distinct count of a truly
    # uniform column sits within a couple of values of its mean (its variance never exceeds the
    # mean — at n=20, k=64 the mean is 17.3 with a standard deviation of 1.5), so a random column
    # misses the bar by many deviations at every sample size the tests run at, and the count
    # scales with n, so a small sample is not mistaken for a small alphabet. A column that is
    # skewed but still reaches most of the alphabet — a biased generator — stays in the region,
    # where chi-square and the bit tests are there to catch it.
