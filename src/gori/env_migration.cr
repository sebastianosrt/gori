  # Re-spelling of STORED env tokens when this install's `Settings.env_syntax` and a project's own
  # marker disagree — the PURE rewrite, with the orchestration around it in `env_migration/store.cr`
  # (a project database, at the moment a surface opens it) and `env_migration/globals.cr`
  # (settings.json's global rewrite rules, at the moment the install's grammar moves).
  #
  # It exists because a grammar switch only changes how stored bytes are READ: without this, an
  # operator whose project is full of `$API_KEY` drafts would be holding text that is now literal.
  # Nothing asks them — see `EnvMigration.reconcile`.
  #
  # ## The contract
  #
  # The rewrite is driven by the reader of the syntax being LEFT (`from`), so "what that grammar
  # would have substituted" is exactly what gets re-spelled. `Env.read_token_at` is that reader —
  # not a regex — which is what makes the offsets agree with what the old grammar actually did,
  # escapes and adjacency included.
  #
  # The invariant is WIRE EQUIVALENCE: the bytes a send seam puts on the socket must be the same
  # before and after. That is stronger than "re-spell the tokens", and it is what forces the
  # escape work below:
  #
  #   * bare → namespaced, in REQUEST text: bare's send seam CONSUMED `$$` (`$$id` shipped `$id`),
  #     while under the namespaced grammar `$$` is two literal bytes. So `$$` becomes a single
  #     `$` — unless what follows is a `NS.NAME`, where `$$ENV.X` is already the namespaced
  #     escape for the same bytes and is left exactly as it stands.
  #   * namespaced → bare: a literal `$NAME` whose NAME the bare grammar WOULD resolve has to
  #     become `$$NAME`, and a literal sigil that bare would pair into an escape has to be
  #     doubled, or the wire changes under the operator.
  #
  # Not every input is representable in the target grammar. `$$$id` under bare ships a literal
  # `$` immediately followed by `id`'s VALUE, and the namespaced grammar has no spelling for that
  # (`$$ENV.id` is the escape, so the `$` and the token cannot sit side by side). `safe?` is the
  # check for it — the caller runs it and SKIPS the row rather than shipping different bytes.
  #
  # ONE difference is structural and is not a defect: a BINDING with no value ships literally, and
  # its literal is its spelling, so a `$FOO` that went out as four bytes goes out as `$BIND.FOO`
  # after the rewrite. `safe?` judges the RESOLVED wire (every name gets a sentinel value), which
  # is the case a re-spelling exists for; the CLI says the other case out loud instead.
  module EnvMigration
    # WHICH grammar the text belongs to, which is a different question from which SYNTAX spells
    # its tokens. `$$` and `$1` mean different things in a request, in a rewrite rule's
    # replacement and in a line of display text, and a migration that gets that wrong silently
    # edits an operator's payload.
    # A kind answers THREE questions, and they are not the same question:
    #
    #   1. does `$$` belong to this grammar (`consumes_escape?`),
    #   2. which TABLES does this consumer resolve a bare name out of, and IN WHICH ORDER
    #      (`route`) — because bare resolved a name by shape and each consumer ran a different
    #      set of passes over it,
    #   3. and can a literal sigil the target grammar WOULD resolve be escaped at all
    #      (`escapes_literal?`).

      Request
      # A rewriter rule's `replacement`. `Rules#substitute` owns `$$` (→ one `$`, nothing behind
      # it read) and `$1..$9` (a regex backref) in BOTH syntaxes, so both are copied through and
      # only a `$NAME` token is re-spelled. Under bare it resolves against ONE merged table
      # (`Env.display_vars`) in which the BINDING values are layered over the env vars, so a name
      # held in both resolved to the BINDING — the opposite of a request.

      # A session-slot header VALUE. `$$` is the send seam's, exactly as in a request

    #     resolves BIND alone. An env-only name there is not a token at all: it shipped as literal
    #     text under bare, and leaving it a bare literal is the same wire. The DECLARED set rather
