module Gori
  # Web cache DECEPTION check (#1247, PortSwigger "Gotta cache 'em all") — a small tool that
  # BORROWS the Authorize engine rather than reimplementing a send loop.
  #
  # The test: replay a captured request as its captured (AUTHENTICATED) identity to PRIME any
  # cache, re-request the SAME url anonymously, then use an anonymous cache-busted query as a
  # control. Matching control content supports a public verdict only when the control itself has
  # no cache-hit signal; a control HIT may mean the cache ignored the query. Matching anonymous
  # content with a cache hit and different control content is a deception candidate. The
  # delimiter tricks that make a cache key an origin ignores (`;`, `.css`, `%00`, …) are the
  # Fuzzer's `cache-delimiters` payload set.
  #
  # This is EXACTLY the shape `Authorize::Engine` already runs — baseline-first (so the
  # authenticated send primes before the anonymous one, ordered not raced), each on its own
  # connection, judged against the baseline — so the engine is reused verbatim. What this module
  # adds are the fixed identities and a verdict that reads the facts Authorize does not: the
  # anonymous response's `Gori::CacheStatus` and the cache-busted control response. The control
  # uses the same `Authorize::Engine` and sender path, with only its request-target varied.
  module CacheDeception

    # are the two the Authorize tab's built-in "anonymous" strips, and they are the credential

    # no-session one.

      Cached
      # The anonymous re-request got matching content but had no cache-hit evidence, or its
      # cache-busted control matched without cache-hit evidence. It is not confirmed deception.
