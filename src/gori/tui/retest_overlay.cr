  # The RETEST card for one Issue (#1036): the ordered Repeater sends that reproduce the
  # finding, and the result table the last run produced.
  #
  # A CARD rather than a third pane in the Issue detail, and the row budget is the reason.
  # `IssuesView#detail_split` already clamps RELATED down to nothing on a short terminal to
  # keep NOTES a single text row, so a permanently-mounted third card would take rows from
  # the pane an operator reads and types in — for a feature most issues never configure. The
  # detail carries a ONE-LINE retest summary instead, drawn only when the issue has a
  # retest, and this card is where the steps are edited and run.
  #
  # Two modes in one card, toggled with ⇥: STEPS is the plan, RESULTS is what the last run
  # said. They are the same object's two halves — the issue's own table has role, name,
  # expected AND actual in one row — and splitting them into two modals would mean losing
  # the plan's cursor every time a run finished.
  #
  # Every domain edge is injected at the open-site (`Runner#open_retest_overlay`): add,
  # edit, move, remove, run, stop, and opening a result row's recorded flow. The card itself
  # never touches the Store.
