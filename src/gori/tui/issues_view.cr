    # `set_text` REPLACES the buffer, and it zeroes the caret and the scroll and clears the
    # undo stack with it. That is right when the stored writeup has MOVED and pure loss every
    # other time — and "every other time" is what both hot callers actually pass: the
    # data_version tick re-reads an open detail ~1.3×/s while capturing (#1122), and `i`
    # re-seeds on the way into INSERT (#1123). Each one dragged the operator's reading
    # position back to line 0 — the first over and over, the second exactly when they had
    # finished scrolling to the paragraph they meant to edit.
    #
    # So ask the BUFFER, not the baseline: `notes_key` is the same LF projection `#text` hands
    # back, so `@notes.text == key` is exactly "replacing the document would change nothing".
    # It is the guard FuzzerView#reconcile and NotesView#soft_merge_from already keep in front
    # of their own `set_text`, for this same reason. Comparing against `@notes_base` instead
    # would answer the same in the two cases above and the WRONG way on the third: `save_notes`
    # re-seeds with the text it just committed, and the baseline it is measured against is
    # still the PRE-EDIT value at that moment — so the compare would call the buffer stale and
    # land the caret back on line 1 of the writeup the operator had just finished.
    #
    # A discard (`^W`) is the case that still replaces: the buffer holds typed text the stored
    # row does not, the compare says so, and the caret resets with the text it belonged to.
    #
    # The bookkeeping below runs either way. `@notes_base` and the announce latch belong to
    # the ISSUE this detail is holding, not to the bytes: `open_detail_issue` re-seeds when the
    # operator opens a DIFFERENT row, whose notes may well be byte-identical (two empty
