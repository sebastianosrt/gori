module Gori::Tui
  # The unified Preferences modal — ONE grouped settings surface reachable everywhere:
  # in-app (Ctrl+, / the ⚙ top-bar chip / the "Settings: …" palette entries) and the
  # project picker (Ctrl+,). It replaces both the small per-section overlay card and the
  # (removed) Settings tab, so there is a single settings paradigm — a modal layer — in
  # every context.
  #
  # Groups + sections come from SettingsCatalog. A :form section edits INLINE via a
  # per-section SettingsView (the shared field engine — render_fields_into / toggle_or_move
  # / insert / save), so the modal and any remaining SettingsView surface can't diverge. A
  # :opener section (theme list, tabs/hosts/env/hotkeys editors) is a single "↵ open" row
  # whose action the HOST performs — the view stays self-contained and returns an Outcome
  # the caller acts on, so the SAME view works in the Runner (opens the dedicated overlay,
  # live-applies a save) and the picker. `allowed_openers` gates which opener sections show
  # + fire: nil = all (in-app); the picker passes a small set (just :theme, which it can
  # host as a card) so tabs/hosts/env/hotkeys stay hidden there.
  class PreferencesView
    # What a keystroke asks the host to do. :saved / :open / :reset carry the section
    # symbol; :saved also carries the toast the host shows after its own live-apply.
    # :reset is the one the view CANNOT perform itself: an opener row has no working copy
    # here (unlike a form row, whose ^R edits one and waits for ↵), so restoring it means
    # writing to disk — which needs a confirm, and confirms belong to the host.
