  # ONE picker for "attach this evidence somewhere": every issue and every note in the
  # project on a single filtered list, with `+ New issue…` / `+ New note…` pinned above
  # them.
  #
  # It replaces the IssuePicker/NotePicker pair, which split the same decision across two
  # verbs (`Space k` / `Space u`). That split made the operator commit to an OWNER KIND
  # before seeing what existed, and it buried create twice over: the create row only ever
  # appeared in the list you had already chosen, so "file the issue this session obviously
  # needs" meant guessing the right verb first. Kind is a column here, not a mode — the
  # filter matches the kind word too, so `note auth` narrows to notes and `issue xss` to
  # issues without leaving the card.
  #
  # The kind is `Store::LinkOwnerKind` itself, not a local mirror of it: this type's whole
  # job is to hand the Runner an owner to write an `entity_links` row against, and a second
  # two-member enum next to that one is a silent mis-attach waiting for the third member.
  #
  # A dumb form object on the Overlay seam like its predecessors: which ref gets attached,
  # and what the two create rows do, are both the injected `on_commit` (Runner#link_attach).
  class LinkPicker < FilterPickerOverlay
    # `label` is what the list draws (`#12 [high] SQLi`, `3:Auth notes`); `name` is the
    # owner's own title, for the messages the Runner writes — a toast must not echo `3:`,
    # which is a sub-tab position that changes when an earlier note closes.
