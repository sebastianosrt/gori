  # One notification's LONG FORM (#1090) — the card ↵ opens on a ring row that carries a
  # `detail`, over the notification center it was opened from.
  #
  # The ring is the sparse interrupt channel: one line per note, clipped to a 60-column row.
  # That is the right shape for "Miner: 3 params found" and the wrong one for an agent's
  # reply, which is the one message in the ring whose VALUE is the paragraph. Before this,
  # anything past the row's width was simply not reachable — the note held it, nothing drew
  # it. So the summary stays the row and the detail gets a card.
