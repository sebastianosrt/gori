  # list (an issue's severity or triage status, the Probe scan mode). Structurally a twin
  # of BrowserPicker: a dumb list, while WHAT the pick applies to rides in as the
  # `on_commit` closure each open-site injects. Each row is fronted by a mnemonic key
  # (helix feel) and the value currently set is marked "● current".

    # reached with ↑/↓ and ↵ instead.
