    # characters, so `highlight_spans` paints nothing and there is nothing on screen to say a
    # selection exists. Reporting one anyway made `y` copy "" (the `|| current_line` fallback

    # A VERTICAL step KEEPS THE COLUMN, clamped to the line it lands on — exactly what the
    # unshifted branch below does, so ⇧↓ ends where a plain ↓ would. It used to snap the caret
    # to the destination line's END instead, and that snap was wrong in both directions:
    #
    # - UPWARD it selected nothing. The boundary columns belong to their document-order lines
    #   (see `selection_text`), so a caret above the anchor puts the CARET column on the top
    #   line — and the caret was at that line's EOL, making the top line contribute `line[EOL..]`
    #   = "". From column 0, the whole of ⇧↑ was one "\n": `highlight_spans` painted no band at
    #   all and `y` copied a single byte. Live: ⇧↓⇧↓ in the Comparer copied 47b, ⇧↑ copied 1b.
    # - DOWNWARD it only LOOKED line-wise, and only when `cx` happened to be 0. Arrive on the
    #   line by pressing → a few times first and ⇧↓ started mid-line.
    #
    # `move_to`, the path a soft-wrapped pane already takes, has always kept the column and
    # states the rule this now shares: "⇧↓ has to end exactly where a plain ↓ would or the
    # selection covers rows the operator never crossed". The History detail runs on it and is
    # the pane where ⇧↑ works today; this is the same behaviour for everything else.

    # correctly in both directions rather than as a side effect of an EOL snap.
