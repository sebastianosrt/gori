module Gori::Tui
  # The custom-headers editor for a Discover run: a plain multi-line text editor,
  # one "Name: Value" per line. Opened from the Discover config popup's headers row;
  # esc saves the parsed headers and returns to the popup.
  # Host/Connection are always emitted by the engine, so entering them here is a
  # no-op (dropped on parse).
  #
  # A SUB-EDITOR on the Overlay seam (see overlay.cr): it has no cancel path at all, so
  # both esc and click-away commit, and the injected closure writes the parsed headers
  # back onto the Discover popup and re-opens it.
  #
  # A line gori will NOT send is a refusal, not a drop. `Headers.parse_lines` used to be
  # called here with its `rejected` out-collector omitted, so a value carrying CR/LF — a
  # request-splitting primitive, correctly refused — vanished with no word: the overlay
  # said `custom headers: 1 set`, 284 probes went out with ZERO carrying `Authorization`,
  # and the run reported `1 endpoint`. An authenticated sweep that runs unauthenticated
  # and reports "found nothing" over the whole authenticated surface is the worst way this
  # can fail, so esc now REFUSES to close while a line is unusable and names it. Deleting
  # or fixing the line always resolves it, and a blank line is not a header anyone asked
  # for (parse_lines skips those without reporting them).
  #
  # The refusal holds ONLY while the card that explains it is on screen. It used to hold
  # unconditionally, and that was a trap with no keyboard exit: `overlay_box` bails below
  # a 34x8 card while `Layout.usable?` admits 40x8, so a band of short bodies is
  # live-but-unrenderable — the refusal was drawn on a branch that never ran, esc and
  # click-away both answered :stay, and the one line that DID draw advertised a dead key.
  # Only ^C/^D (quitting gori) or a resize got out. A refusal nobody can read is a lock,
  # not a guard: where the editor cannot show the line, esc saves and the degraded line
  # says how many lines that drops, so the save is still never silent.
