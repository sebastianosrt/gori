  # A small centered picker for the "copy as X" action (space → Y): pick which slice
  # of the focused HTTP message to copy — url / headers / body / cookies / curl / raw.
  # Structurally a twin of ChoicePicker, but each row carries the payload `text`
  # outright and shows its byte size rather than a "current" marker — there's no
  # persisted value here, just a one-shot copy. Rows are fronted by a mnemonic key.
  #
  # PROMPT-TIER on the Overlay seam: the clipboard write is the injected `on_commit`
  # (Runner#copy_as_open) like any migrated modal, but the Runner keeps this in its own
  # slot rather than @active_overlay, because the picker must float over the History
  # detail drill-in without collapsing it and must claim keys before the ^G/^F guards.
  class CopyPicker < PlainPickerOverlay
    # DELIBERATELY doubles as `Overlay#title`, the shell's focus badge — the pre-seam
    # `focus_label` read this very field (`@copy_picker.try(&.title)`), so the badge and
    # the card heading have always been one string. Crystal has no `override` keyword, so
    # a field silently satisfying an abstract method is easy to do BY ACCIDENT and wrong
    # most of the time (see SendPicker, whose heading is a sentence, not a region name).
    # Here it is intended; the spec pins both.
