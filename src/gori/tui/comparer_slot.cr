  # ONE side of a Comparer comparison.
  #
  # A slot used to BE a `Store::FlowDetail`, which is why the tab could only ever diff two
  # CAPTURED flows: the flow picker and History's handoff are the only two things in the tree
  # that hand one over. A Repeater send, a Fuzz result and a Sitemap endpoint all hold the
  # same two messages and no flow row to wrap them in, so none of them could reach the
  # Comparer at all — the operator had to find the capture the send happened to leave behind
  # (and a Repeater/WS/gRPC tab leaves none: those are session-only, `db_id` nil).
  #
  # So a slot is the BYTES plus whatever labelling the source can supply, and `from_flow` is
  # one constructor among several. The meta readout (status · size · time) rides here too:
  # it is per-side data, and every source that can name its bytes can name those as well.

    getter method : String # sub-tab filter subject (`method:`)

    getter host : String   # authority alone, for the header summary
    getter path : String   # origin-form path, for the header summary
    # Where these bytes came from, when it is not the capture history: "repeater", "fuzz", …
    # Shown as a header prefix so an A/B pair of a captured flow against a live re-send says
    # which side is which — the two otherwise render identically.

    # where every row is "GET /api" — cannot be told apart by the derived name, so the name
    # it DID supply has to ride the A/B header too and not just the sub-tab chip.
