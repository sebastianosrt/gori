  # The canned-response editor for a short-circuit rule (#511): a plain multi-line buffer
  # holding a raw HTTP response — a status line, header lines, a blank line, then the body.
  # Opened from the Rewriter rule form's `response:` row; esc saves and returns to the form.
  #
  # It exists as a SUB-EDITOR rather than another row on the form because a response is the
  # one rule field that is genuinely multi-line, and squeezing it into a `TextField` would
  # mean inventing an escape syntax for the newlines. Same shape as `DiscoverHeadersOverlay`,
  # for the same reason and with the same seam: there is no cancel path — the operator is
  # still inside the rule form — so esc and click-away both commit, and the injected closure
  # writes the buffer back onto the form and re-opens it.
