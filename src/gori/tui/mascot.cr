  # Miss Ring's art: a 3-row x 8-column gilded hoop with a lashed cartoon face in it.
  # Motif is Loki's Miss Minutes (huge eyes, lashes) crossed with Claude's mascot (soft
  # rounded forms, minimal face); the SHAPE is the gori mark itself — a ring — painted in
  # the live palette's brand gold.
  #
  # Pure and stateless: art tables, an ink (role) layer, a palette resolver and a draw
  # loop. Everything about WHEN she moves lives in Companion; everything about HOW she looks
  # lives here.
  #
  # WHY THE SILHOUETTE IS ROUND AND NOT OVAL. A terminal row is about twice as tall as a
  # cell is wide, so three rows buy six units of height — and to read as a circle rather
  # than an oval the equator has to be six CELLS across, not seven. Half-block walls put
  # it exactly there, and the crown then tapers half a cell per step:
  #
  #       col:  0    1   2 3 4   5    6    7
  #   row 0:   ' '   ▄   ▀ ▀ ▀   ▄   ' '  badge
  #   row 1:    ▐   <-- face 5 -->    ▌   ' '
  #   row 2:   ' '   ▀   ▄ ▄ ▄   ▀   ' '  ' '
  #
  #   equator  ▐ x[0.5,1] .. ▌ x[6,6.5]        = 6.0 cells
  #   y 0.5-1  ▄ at col 1 and col 5            = 5.0 cells
  #   y 0-0.5  ▀ at cols 2..4                  = 3.0 cells
  #
  # A circle of diameter six wants 6 / 5.2 / 3.3 at those bands, so the profile lands on
  # it. Every step is half a cell, which is what keeps the arc smooth instead of notched.
  #
  # THE COST IS THE ARMS. A half-block wall starts at x=0.5, but a `╺` stub in the column
  # to its left ends at x=1.0 of that column — half a cell short. Nothing can bridge it
  # without making the wall a full block, which would push the equator back to seven cells
  # and lose the circle. So she has no arms, and the badge column carries mood instead.

    # ᴗ (U+1D17 BOTTOM HALF O) is the same cup at the right height, and rounder. It was

    # where ᴗ is Neutral. Measured in a real terminal, ▐´●ᴗ●`▌ is the same 7 cells as the

    # proportional fallback face, and an environment with no fallback pool at all draws a
    # box. u is the same cup at the same x-height and is in every monospace font, which is
    # why the mouth is spelled with it and there is no setting to change that.
