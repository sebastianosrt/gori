module Gori::Tui
  # A small centered picker for the "send selection to X" action (space → S): pick a
  # string-handling destination for the current text selection. Structurally a twin
  # of CopyPicker, but every row shares ONE `@payload` (the selection) and differs
  # only by destination — so rows show the target's `hint` (not a per-row byte size),
  # and the card title carries the payload size once. Rows are fronted by a mnemonic key.
  #
  # PROMPT-TIER on the Overlay seam, exactly like CopyPicker: the send is the injected
  # `on_commit` (Runner#send_to_open), but the Runner keeps it out of @active_overlay so
  # it floats over @overlay instead of replacing it.
