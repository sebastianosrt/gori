    # an insert can merge the caret's char into the preceding cluster, and a caller-
    # supplied index (place_cursor / place_at_offset / undo) is unconstrained.

    # and they sit at the same column / the next column, so crossing the whole run is one
    # keypress in each direction (no dead press). `dir` is the travel sign.

    # binds to that `§`, making b + 1 cluster interior. So round it up. Forward is the only
