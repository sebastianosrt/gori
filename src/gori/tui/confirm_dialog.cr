  # A centered yes/no confirmation modal for destructive actions — deleting a
  # project, closing a Repeater/Notes sub-tab. Selection defaults to Cancel — the safe
  # choice — so a reflexive ↵ never destroys anything; the operator must move to (or
  # press `y` for) the danger button on purpose.
  #
  # The archetype the Overlay seam was modelled on: WHAT a confirmation does is injected
  # as the `on_commit` closure at the open-site (Runner#confirm), so the dialog itself
  # only knows which button is lit. `on_close` (Overlay) carries the other half the Runner
  # used to hold in `@confirm_return`: a confirm raised from inside another modal lands
  # back in it, on cancel and on accept alike.
  #
  # ALSO used outside the Runner, by ProjectPicker, which drives it as a plain state +
  # rendering object through its own `:confirm` mode and ignores the Overlay hooks.

    # selection (which defaults to cancel). EVERY other key is swallowed so nothing leaks
    # to the view behind the card.
    #
    # `y` is guarded on ctrl/alt because `key.y?` is termisu's CASE-INSENSITIVE macro: it
    # compares the key enum alone and knows nothing about modifiers, so an unguarded branch
    # reads every `^Y` as the destructive answer to a card whose hint only ever advertises a
    # bare `y`. `^Y` is a live chord — it is now COPY in every text box, which makes this guard
    # load-bearing on a hotter path than before: the marker-removal confirm pops up inside the
    # request editor, exactly where an operator reaches for `^Y` to copy. (It was
    # repeater.attach-chain when this guard was written; that verb has since moved to `^Q`, and
    # the guard outlived the specific chord because the RULE is about modifiers, not about which
    # verb owns them.) Shift is deliberately NOT guarded — `key.y?` matches
    # UpperY on purpose, and a shifted/caps-locked `Y` is the advertised mnemonic. `n`/esc
    # stay unguarded too: a modified key that CANCELS costs one keystroke, one that COMMITS
    # destroys data, so the strictness is spent only where the harm is.
    #
    # Extracted as a class method because ProjectPicker drives this card as a plain state
    # object through its own key ladder (`handle_confirm`) and never reaches `handle_key` —
    # so the rule lived in two places and only one of them got the guard, leaving `^Y` wired
    # to `rm_rf` on a project. One predicate, both call sites: the next answer key that needs
    # a rule cannot land in one ladder and miss the other.
