  # The ADDITIONAL-listener inventory: every socket this session serves besides the primary
  # bind, opened from the `listeners:N` top-bar chip (or the app.listeners palette entry).
  # Read-only — the section is edited in `settings.json`, and there is no TUI editor for it to
  # duplicate.

  # This is the second half of the #499 address decision. The primary bind stays THE proxy
  # address — the singular thing a client is configured against, and the only address gori can
  # move under the operator — so it keeps the `● host:port` chip to itself. Everything here was
  # typed into settings.json by the operator, so it needs confirming rather than announcing,
  # and an inventory is the shape that does that without making any of the six primary-bind
  # surfaces answer "which one?".
  #
  # It is also the first consumer of `Session#listener_errors`. That list has been collected
  # correctly since additional listeners existed and displayed nowhere, so a listener that
  # failed to bind — or was rejected as unusable before it ever got a socket — was invisible,
  # and the only symptom was traffic that never arrived.
