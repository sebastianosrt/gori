module Gori::Tui
  # Translates a termisu key event into a Verb::Chord so the keymap (which is
  # terminal-agnostic) can resolve it. This is the one place TUI key encoding
  # meets the verb layer.
  module Keybind
    # Fold an ⌥-aliased event for the CLAIMED family back onto its Ctrl form, so the ~51
    # hardcoded `ev.ctrl? && key.lower_p?`-style guards spread across the Runner, the
    # overlays and the controllers keep working untouched. Identity unless
    # Settings.command_modifier is "alt", and identity for anything outside
    # Hotkeys::CLAIMED_KEYS (⌥R stays ⌥R and reaches the keymap normally).
    #
    # Applied per event loop — Runner#handle_key, ProjectPicker, Tutorial — AFTER each
    # loop's ^C/^D quit arm and (in the Runner) after the hotkey-capture branch, so quit
    # stays Ctrl-only and the Hotkeys editor still records ⌥-chords verbatim.
    #
    # Two normalizations matter:
    #   • ⌥⇧P arrives as Key::UpperP (the parser reads "\eP" → from_char('P')), while
    #     Ctrl+Shift+P is byte-identical to ^P. Downcasing the key and clearing Shift makes
    #     both paths land on the same event a `key.lower_p?` guard expects.
    #   • `char: nil` matches what the Ctrl+letter parser branch produces; Event::Key#char
    #     falls back to key.to_char, so the digit guards (`ev.char || key.to_char`) are
    #     unaffected either way.
    #
    # A ⌃⌥-carrying event is left alone: it already satisfies `ev.ctrl?`, so rewriting it
    # would change nothing except the shift/alt flags.
