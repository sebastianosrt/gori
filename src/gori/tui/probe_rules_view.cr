  # Findings sub-tab. Three sections — built-in PASSIVE and ACTIVE rules (per-rule enable/disable,
  # stored per project) and user-defined CUSTOM rules (string/regex matches, global or project
  # scope). Purely presentational: it owns the row list + selection + rendering; the controller
  # performs every persistence write (toggle / add / edit / delete) then calls reload.

    # key); `custom` carries the whole rule for edit/delete. `note` is a short right-aligned
    # badge ("opt-in", "needs OAST") and `desc` the one-line description shown in the footer
    # when this row is selected.
