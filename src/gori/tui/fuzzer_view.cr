    #
    # Which is exactly why the bytes get two things done to them here and nowhere else:
    #
    #   * every `§` is escaped to the `§§` literal `Fuzz::Template.parse` already defines.
    #     `§…§` is this pane's INJECTION-POSITION syntax, but `§` is also U+00A7, ordinary
    #     text a German or legal body carries constantly — so a captured `"mk":"§SEED§"`
    #     used to arrive as a live position the operator never marked, and a run replaced
    #     the site's own text with every payload in the set. Escaping keeps the bytes:
    #     `render` puts the single `§` back on the wire, the Content-Length still agrees,
    #     and ^K still marks whatever the operator actually points at. (RepeaterView's
    #     `space ▸ f` seed applies the same escape at the same kind of seam.)
    #   * no `.scrub`. A capture is EVIDENCE and may legitimately not be valid UTF-8 — a
    #     protobuf/gRPC frame, a gzip'd POST, a latin-1 form field. Scrubbing rewrote each
    #     such byte to the three bytes of U+FFFD before the operator ever saw the request,
    #     and `Plan.build` then resynced Content-Length to the corruption. `Template.parse`

    # them is right for a tab that has an editor in it:
    #
    #   * the unresolved-`$KEY` refusal and `$KEY` SUBSTITUTION — off, and that is the whole
    #     point. A capture's `$filter`/`$top`/`$where`/`$IFS`/`$user.name` are bytes the
    #     origin sent, not variables anybody typed. With them on, a captured OData request
    #     was refused outright, and the refusal's own remedy ("set the variable") rewrote the
    #     PARAMETER NAMES on the wire (`?PWNED=aa&99=10`) while the TEMPLATE pane still read
    #     `$filter=§…§` and the screen said `6 hits / 6 sent`.
    #   * the head's LF→CRLF promotion — which `expand_wire` did, and which this editor still
    #     OWES the wire. `TextArea#insert_newline` gives a line the user typed `DEFAULT_EOL`
    #     ("\n") and documents `expand_wire` as what promotes it back; without that, adding
    #     one header to a seeded capture would put a bare LF in the head — itself a
    #     front-end/back-end desync primitive, i.e. a different test than the one on screen.
    #     So the view runs the head-only normalization itself. It is idempotent on a head
    #     that already carries CRLF (`Env.normalize_crlf` only inserts a CR before an LF that
    #     has none), the body is copied through byte-for-byte, and no `$` is touched.
    #
    # Provenance is about where the bytes CAME FROM, so an operator edit does not clear it:
    # ^A/^K only insert §/¦ within a line (`restore_wire_eols` keeps every terminator), and

    # here rather than replayed. gori's proxy refuses to capture such a head at all (P7), so
    # it is not reachable through the proxy; `gori run repeater --verbatim` is the byte-exact
    # route for one.
