  # cards' scroll state, the INPUT card with its READ/INS badge and the lens chip, and the
  # read-only text card both lenses draw from. The lens layouts, the second lens's editors and

    # the sibling ` ↵:READ ` chip names its own mode — would repeat what the card titles
    # under it already state, and ` ^T:DECODE ` riding a decoding pane reads as "^T decodes
    # this", i.e. as a key that does something else. `chord` comes from the keymap, so a
    # rebind moves this and the footer together — and `lens_chord:` is REQUIRED on both
    # render entry points rather than defaulting to `"^T"`, so a second render path cannot
    # quietly paint the default at someone who rebound the switch.
