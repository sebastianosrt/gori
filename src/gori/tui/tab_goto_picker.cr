  # The `0` key's Go-to picker: a type-to-filter list over the WHOLE tab catalog — the nine
  # numbered slots AND everything settings:tabs keeps off the bar — where ↵ jumps.
  #
  # Every row reads the same. An off-bar row used to wear a `·`, a muted label and the literal
  # word "hidden", which is the vocabulary of the tab-HIDING feature the nine slots replaced:
  # it said "this tab is off" about a tab that opens on the next keypress. The only thing being
  # off the bar actually costs a tab is a digit, so the digit is the only thing the card says
  # about it, and the dim is spent on the COLUMN (a summary is a step below its label) rather
  # than on the ROW.
  #
  # It replaces the ⋯ dropdown (`MoreMenu`), and not for tidiness. The bar is nine slots and
  # the catalog is twenty-one tabs, so the "more" list is no longer a short overflow of one or
  # two: it is a DOZEN, which is a list you type at rather than one you walk. The dropdown had
  # no filter, no way to reach a tab that WAS on the bar, and its own key table; this is the
  # sub-tab picker's structure one level up (FilterPickerOverlay — in-memory substring filter,
  # IME preedit, ↑/↓, ↵), so the two levels of "find me a tab" now answer to the same keys.
  #
  # A dumb form object on the Overlay seam, like its sibling: the jump itself is the injected
  # `on_commit` (Runner#open_tab_goto), which force-shows a hidden tab exactly as the palette's
  # "Go to …" does.
