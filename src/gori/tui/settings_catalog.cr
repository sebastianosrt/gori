module Gori::Tui
  # The ONE list of settings sections. Both surfaces read it, so they can't drift:
  #   - the Ctrl-P palette registers a `settings.*` verb per entry (verbs/core.cr)
  #   - the Settings tab builds its grouped sub-tabs from the same entries
  # Adding a section is a single row here — it then appears in both places.
  #
  # Before this existed the section symbol lived only inside each verb's handler
  # closure (unreadable as data), and "what sections exist" was duplicated across the
  # palette verbs, SettingsView::SECTIONS, and the Runner dispatch. This lifts the
  # identity into data so the tab can enumerate sections the same way the palette does.
  module SettingsCatalog
    # `kind` decides how the Settings tab presents the section:
    #   :form   → editable inline via the shared SettingsView field engine
    #   :opener → a single row whose ↵ opens the section's dedicated overlay
    #             (theme list, tabs/env/hotkeys editors) — reusing open_settings.
    #   :action → a single row whose ↵ asks the HOST to run one verb (the factory reset).
    #             Neither a form to edit nor an editor to open; the row shows `desc`, since
    #             the group subheader already carries `title`.
    # `sym` is the argument passed to open_settings (also the section's identity);
    # `id`/`desc` are the palette verb's id + description (kept verbatim); `title` is
    # the short label used for the sub-tab group members and section subheaders.
    # `in_tab` is false for a section reachable another way (Hostnames lives as an
    # opener FIELD inside Network) so it still gets a palette verb but no tab row.
