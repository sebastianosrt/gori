  # The CVSS base-metric builder behind an issue's `cvss` field (#575), for v3.1 and v4.0.
  #
  # TWO ways in, one value out. The `vector:` row is an ordinary text field — paste a
  # `CVSS:3.1/…` or `CVSS:4.0/…` string, or type the bare score (`8.8`) you were handed —
  # and the metric rows under it are the builder for everyone who would rather pick than
  # spell. They stay in step both ways: editing the field re-selects the metrics (and moves
  # the version row) whenever what is in it parses as a version this card can spell, and
  # touching any control rewrites the field. A bare score has no metrics to mirror, so the
  # rows stop tracking it until the next metric edit takes the vector back.
  #
  # That field is why the form's own cvss row is a LAUNCHER: one place to type a vector, one
  # place to build one, and `↵` on the row opens this. Two editable copies of the same value
  # on two cards is how they drift.
  #
  # VERSIONS ARE SEPARATE ASSESSMENTS, not two spellings of one. v4.0 asks questions v3.1
  # does not (`AT`, and the Vulnerable/Subsequent impact split that replaces `S`), and its
  # `UI` has three values where v3.1 has two — FIRST's own guidance is that the two are not
  # convertible. So the version row does not translate: each version keeps its OWN
  # selections, remembered while the card is open, and toggling back restores exactly what
  # you had. Nothing is lost and nothing is invented — a translated vector would put a score
  # in someone's report that nobody assessed.
  #
  # Geometry and controls are the SHARED rule-form ones — `Overlay.rule_form_box`,
  # `Frame.option_cycle`, `Overlay#draw_field`, `Viewport.scroll_to_show` — so this modal has
  # the hands every other form in gori has: ↑/↓ row, ←/→ option, ↵ save, esc cancel. The
  # first cut drew its own 72×14 card with option pills pinned to `box.x + 28`, its own
  # Apply/Cancel buttons and a second copy of the key hint the shell already prints for
  # `hint`. All three ran past the card's own border below ~76 columns, and `Screen#text`
  # clips to the SCREEN, not to the box — so the overflow landed ON the frame, and the
  # in-card hint overwrote the Cancel button even at full width.
