    # Every card that wanted one used to hand-roll this, and the copies had drifted into
    # different magic numbers for the same layout: the Rewriter list guarded on
    # `rect.w > meta.size + 20` and floored at `rect.x + 18`, its Colormarker twin at `+ 18`
    # and `+ 16`, so the two lists dropped their count at different widths. Neither number
    # was derived from anything — the title they were protecting is right there. `Frame.card`
    # draws its title as ` TITLE ` from `rect.x + 2`, which is the only fact this needs, and
    # it is now stated once.
    #
    # Draws nothing when the card is too narrow to hold the meta clear of the title, which is
    # what makes it safe to call unconditionally.
    # `min_x` overrides the left stop for a card whose border carries more than a title —
    # the Repeater's RESPONSE header runs a left-anchored `chip` cluster there, so the meta
    # has to clear the chips rather than the (shorter) title. Callers pass the x their own
    # chrome ended at; everyone else lets the title decide.
    #
    # Returns the x it drew at, or nil when it drew nothing — so a caller can CHAIN something
    # further left (the Repeater hangs an `⚠ incomplete` marker off the meta it just placed)
    # without re-deriving a position this method already computed.
    # The annotation rides the hairline as ` META `, the same padded run `Frame.card` gives
    # its title and every badge helper below gives its label. Unpadded it butted straight into
    # the dashes on both sides — `╭─ COLORMARKER ─────8/9 enabled─╮`, and a one-token meta
    # (`╭─ PREVIEW INPUT ────REQ─╮`, `╭─ FINDINGS ─────0─╮`) read as debris on the border

    # Sequencer configs drew the value with `‹/›` in the value's own colour, unconditionally.
    #
    # The rule this settles on is neither "always a strip" nor "always the value". A strip is
    # how a choice advertises itself, so it wins WHEN IT FITS — but `MAX_REQ_CHOICES` is eight
    # numbers plus `uncapped`, and forcing that into a 72-column card would push the row off
    # its own edge. So: measure, draw the strip if there is room, otherwise fall back to the
    # lit value alone. One renderer, one look wherever the width allows it, and the fallback is
    # a width response rather than a per-file opinion.
    #
    # `right` is the exclusive right edge the row may use (a card's `box.right - 2`).
    # The `‹/›` cue is drawn ONLY when the row has focus — it names keys that do nothing
    # anywhere else, and several of these forms used to show it on every row at once.

    # Only the Sequencer's config passes one: its rows share a value column with a text field,
