  # The reading half of a named GLOBAL library — the Decoder's saved chain specs and the
  # Rewriter's saved rule presets (NamePromptOverlay writes them).
  #
  # It exists because "load by name" used to mean TYPING the name into a blank one-row
  # prompt, with no way to see what had been saved: a name you couldn't recall was a name
  # you couldn't load, and the only way to find out was to open settings.json. So the detail
  # column is not decoration — showing each entry's SPEC next to its name is the point of
  # the card. Structural twin of SubtabPicker (in-memory substring filter, IME preedit,
  # selection-follow scroll, mouse hit-test) over library entries instead of sub-tabs.
  #
  # A dumb form object on the Overlay seam: the load is the injected `on_commit`, which
  # reads `selected_index`. One picker serves both tabs; `noun` only shapes the empty-state
  # text, so a library with nothing in it says which library.

    # commit; `label` is its name, `detail` the dim searchable spec.

    # open-site like `on_commit`, and for the same reason: the picker knows which row is
    # under the cursor, not which settings section it lives in. nil = a read-only library
    # (the ^X hint then stays off, rather than advertising a key that does nothing).
