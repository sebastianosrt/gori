    # ===== the ⌕ "find sub-tab" affordance ===================================
    # A pill at the LEFT edge of the chip row that opens the sub-tab picker. It lives here
    # rather than in `Chrome` on purpose: `Chrome.render_tab_strip` is also the Project tab's
    # self-drawn strip (project_view.cr) and the Preferences group strip (preferences_view.cr),
    # neither of which is a sub-tab strip. Carving the row one layer up excludes them
    # STRUCTURALLY instead of by a flag those two would have to keep passing as false.

    # `▎ ⌕` — the glyph alone, no session count beside it. The strip's own chips already
    # say how many there are, and the filter bar one row below prints `visible/total`; a
    # number on the pill was a third telling of the same fact, in the one spot on the row
    # that has to stay quiet.
    #
    # Three columns, no breathing room spent on a glyph this small:
    #
    #     col 0    │ col 1 │ col 2
    #     MARKER   │ ICON  │ spare
    #
    # `⌕` (U+2315) and `▎` (U+258E) are both East-Asian AMBIGUOUS: termisu measures each as
    # 1 column, a terminal set to paint ambiguous glyphs double gives them 2. This layout
    # does NOT try to stay correct under that setting, and neither does anything else here —
    # box drawing (U+2500..257F) is ambiguous too, so a terminal in that mode has already
    # doubled every border gori draws. Widening the pill to survive alone would buy nothing
    # and cost the two columns that made a one-glyph control look like an empty chip.
    #
    # The one column kept is `spare`, and it earns its place in the measure we DO ship:
    # `Chrome` writes its `‹` overflow marker at the chips rect's x (chrome.cr:507), and a
    # glyph that ended on that column would be orphaned and blanked by it (the terminal
    # clears a wide glyph's lead when something lands on its continuation cell). The spare
    # is what keeps `⌕` on screen when the strip scrolls.

    # {icon rect, chips rect} for one chip row — the SINGLE source of both. Returned as a

    # `tabs_area` are the same pair one level up. `show: false` (a fixed or self-drawn strip)
    # gives {nil, row}, which is byte-for-byte the layout from before the affordance existed.
    #
    # The icon is dropped when it would not leave room for the FIRST VISIBLE chip plus the
    # two `‹`/`›` overflow columns: an affordance for finding sub-tabs must never be the
