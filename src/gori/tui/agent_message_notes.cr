  # `tell_agent` builds the picker, the DV poll drains deliveries — and `Runner.new` cannot be
  # constructed in a spec (it needs a live terminal), so wording pinned only through the Runner
  # is wording nothing pins. Everything here takes its inputs as arguments, including `now`,
  # so "attached 3m ago" is a computation and not a clock read.

    # reason the AGENTS card's rows do — it is peer-authored text, not gori's own word, and the
    # picker is a place a pathological name could push the row past the card's edge.
