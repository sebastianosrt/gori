module Gori::Tui
  # The startup screen: choose a project to open. New + Temp are always shown at
  # the top. Below them is a Search row (the "search area"). Arrow down to it to
  # "enter" search, then typing narrows the list below it: fuzzy (Gori::Fuzzy,
  # best-first) on the display name, then a substring of the directory slug, the short
  # id or the bound workspace path — the same vocabulary `gori run project list
  # --query` and MCP `list_projects{query}` accept (see ProjectPicker.narrow).
  # Search is *not* live on every keystroke
  # from anywhere (avoids the previous always-on filter which felt inconvenient).
  # On a project row, Space opens a small action menu (open / rename / delete) —
  # same discovery surface as the in-session space menu, scoped to the picker.
  # Use arrows + ↵ , Space, ctrl-n/ctrl-t/ctrl-d etc. Returns chosen Project or nil
  # to quit. Monochrome, keyboard-first (Grok Build feel).
  #
  # The list also MARKS (ProjectMarks): Tab / ⇧Tab flip a project's mark and step, ⇧↑/⇧↓
  # extend a range, ctrl-a marks the whole filter, esc clears. The space menu's Delete then
  # acts on the marks if any are set, else the cursor row — the one target rule History and
  # the Issues list use. The chords deviate from the app-wide `t` / ⇧T ON PURPOSE and cannot
  # be "fixed" back: on this screen every printable key types into the search box (see
  # handle_list), so `t` would filter rather than mark. Tab is fzf's toggle in exactly this
  # shape of list, and ctrl-a is the same select-all everything else spells ⇧T.
  #
  # ctrl-f searches the captured FLOWS of every project rather than their names (#1229, see
  # ProjectSearchOverlay). A chord for the same reason: every printable key is already the
  # name filter's.

    #   • Open returns ONE project (that is the picker's whole return value).
