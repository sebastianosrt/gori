  # The startup screen: choose a project to open. New + Temp are always shown at
  # the top. Below them is a Search row (the "search area"). Arrow down to it to
  # "enter" search, then typing does fuzzy filter (Gori::Fuzzy, best-first) on the
  # projects listed below the search row. Search is *not* live on every keystroke
  # from anywhere (avoids the previous always-on filter which felt inconvenient).
  # On a project row, Space opens a small action menu (open / rename / delete) —
  # same discovery surface as the in-session space menu, scoped to the picker.
  # Use arrows + ↵ , Space, ctrl-n/ctrl-t/ctrl-d etc. Returns chosen Project or nil
  # to quit. Monochrome, keyboard-first (Grok Build feel).
  #
  # The list also MARKS (ProjectMarks): Tab / ⇧Tab flip a project's mark and step, ⇧↑/⇧↓
  # extend a range, ctrl-a marks the whole filter, esc clears. The space menu's Delete then
  # acts on the marks if any are set, else the cursor row — the one target rule History and
  # the Issues list use. The chords deviate from the app-wide `t` / ⇧T ON PURPOSE and cannot
  # be "fixed" back: on this screen every printable key types into the search box (see
  # handle_list), so `t` would filter rather than mark. Tab is fzf's toggle in exactly this
  # shape of list, and ctrl-a is the same select-all everything else spells ⇧T.
