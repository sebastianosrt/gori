module Gori::Tui
  # A guided, standalone tour of gori's TUI, shown right after the setup wizard
  # (when the user opts in) and re-runnable via `gori tutorial`. It is NOT wired
  # into the live Runner: like SetupWizard it owns its own full-screen run loop,
  # so it fully captures input and can't disturb any real session.
  #
  # It teaches the four moves a new user reaches for most — moving between
  # tabs/panes, the action menu (space), the command palette (^P), and edit mode
  # (READ/INS) — each on a harmless MOCK of the real UI (nothing here is real),
  # drawn with the same Screen/Frame/Theme primitives the app uses. Then the traffic
  # itself (#1382): where to point a client and trust the CA, the capture switch, and
  # intercept — the lesson that also untangles `i` (INS in an editor, intercept elsewhere).
  #
  # The menu comes before the palette because the palette's hint column SPELLS menu paths
  # (`Hotkeys.menu_path`, #1282): a search result tells you the letters that reach it next
  # time, and those read as noise to someone who has not yet opened the menu once. The two
  # mocks' rows are real verbs read from the registry, so their letters and keys are the
  # app's, and move when the app's do.
  #
  # Flow: short explanation + looping demo on each lesson, with a soft "try it"
  # goal so users make the whole move at least once; the two traffic lessons; a
  # hands-on Practice sandbox for the four UI moves; Help and quitting; finally a
  # "first session" checklist.
  # Progression is never blocked — clickable Prev/Next buttons always work.

    # Five, not the nine the real bar holds, because a numbered chip costs two cells more
    # than a bare one and the card is 78 columns at its widest: nine would overflow the

    # Split a lesson's interior between its prose and its mock.
    #
    # THE MOCK IS THE LESSON, so it claims SHELL_ROWS off the bottom first and the prose
    # gives way — the muted key-hint rows restate what `footer_hint` already says, while a
    # lesson whose mock did not draw teaches nothing. The old fixed walk did the opposite,
    # and the card MIN_CARD_H admits is three rows shorter than CONTENT_ROWS asks for: at a
    # 12-row card (an 80x16 terminal — the size the "too small" message NAMES as the
    # minimum) it left the shell 4 rows, one under `render_shell`'s floor, so Navigate and
    # Practice painted an EMPTY card under "roam the mock" and "Try: switch a tab, enter
    # body". At 13 and 14 rows the FLOWS pane showed 1 and 2 of its 3 rows, teaching "↓ list"
    # over a list that could not move.
    #
    # Returns {rows of `detail` the prose may keep, the row the mock starts on}. `fixed` is
    # prose rows the lesson always draws (headline, try line, goal chips); `pad` is rows it
    # keeps BELOW the mock.
    # Class methods, like step_card and wrap_sel, so a spec can sweep them over card heights
    # without a tty — this is geometry, and the way it breaks is silently, at one end of a
    # size range nobody renders by hand.

    # ("╰─Re-run this tour anytime: gori tutorial──╯" at 80x16). Practice calls it for the
