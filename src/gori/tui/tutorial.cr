  # (when the user opts in) and re-runnable via `gori tutorial`. It is NOT wired
  # into the live Runner: like SetupWizard it owns its own full-screen run loop,
  # so it fully captures input and can't disturb any real session.
  #
  # It teaches the four moves a new user reaches for most — moving between
  # tabs/panes, the command palette (^P), the action menu (space), and edit mode
  # (READ/INS) — each on a harmless MOCK of the real UI (nothing here is real),
  # drawn with the same Screen/Frame/Theme primitives the app uses.
  #
  # Flow: short explanation + looping demo on each lesson, with a soft "try it"
  # goal so users press the real key at least once; then a hands-on Practice
  # sandbox that encourages all four moves; finally a "first session" checklist.
  # Progression is never blocked — clickable Prev/Next buttons always work.
