module Gori::Tui
  # The "space" action menu — a leader popup CENTERED in the body. Pressing space in
  # a navigable area opens it; it lists that area's own verbs (the Verb::Scope +
  # Verb::Section captured at open), each fronted by a single mnemonic key. Pressing
  # the key runs the verb through the SAME Verb::Definition#call path as a keybinding
  # and the palette (P1 — no separate execution path).
  #
  # Where Ctrl-P's PaletteState is a centered fuzzy-typed modal of every Global verb,
  # the space menu is mnemonic-only (no text input, no fuzzy filter): the shown set is
  # exactly `for_scope` narrowed to verbs that have a `menu_key`. THAT — the
  # interaction, not the position — is what keeps the two surfaces from collapsing
  # into each other. Both are centered cards; one is typed, one is one-keypress. Adding
  # a query line here would make it a second palette wherever it was drawn.
  #
  # Grouping runs on two orthogonal axes:
  #   * `Verb::Definition#section` — FOCUS AREA. Splits into a COMMON band (tab-wide)
  #     and a CONTEXT band (the focused pane / tab bar / sub-tab strip). A section's
  #     verbs appear ONLY while that area is focused.
  #   * `Verb::Definition#group` — SEMANTIC BAND (VIEW / SEND / TRIAGE / COPY / SCOPE /
  #     DANGER). Never gates visibility; it subdivides whatever bands `section`
  #     produced. This is what makes the single-region scopes scannable — History's
  #     Body is 19 entries with no focus sub-areas at all, so `section` alone can
  #     never break it up.
  # A bucket whose verbs are all `:none` keeps its own label and renders exactly as it
  # did before, so an untagged scope is untouched.
  #
  # Layout is a single narrow column until that column would not fit, then COLUMN-MAJOR
  # multi-column (see #layout) — read down, then across. Group headers never strand at
  # a column's last row (#pad_rows); a group larger than the space left in a column
  # does continue into the next one, which reads correctly in down-then-across order.
  # Pure input/state + rendering; the Runner owns opening/closing, capturing the
  # scope+section, and executing the selection.

    # Tallest ONE COLUMN may grow before the layout either adds a column or (when it
    # can't) scrolls. box() still clamps to the body, so this is only the "don't grow
    # past this even on a tall terminal" ceiling. History's Body — the busiest scope at
