  # One exchange, read-only: the request and the response with the provenance line that says
  # where they came from. Two modes over ONE card (#1038, the RELATED-row ↵):
  #
  #   * FROZEN — a copy from `issue_evidence`, the bytes exactly as they were taken, with the
  #     moment of the copy and its stored hashes.
  #   * LIVE   — a `Evidence::Snapshot` of a source AS IT IS NOW, built on the keypress. It is
  #     the same bytes the freeze would copy, shown without copying them, and the card says so
  #     in every place it would otherwise say "frozen": retention or the next send can still
  #     change what this shows.
  #
  # One class, not two, because everything below the title is identical work — the panes, the
  # entity decoding, the display cap, the scroll, the `y` copy. Only the provenance says which
  # kind of answer this is.
  #
  # It is a modal over the Issues detail and NOT the History drill-in, though the
  # drill-in is "the normal request/response viewer". The drill-in's verbs act on a LIVE
  # flow id — delete it, link it, probe it, send it to the Repeater — and a snapshot has
  # no live id to act on; every one of those would have to be gated, and one missed gate
  # is an operator deleting the flow they thought they were reading a copy of. A modal
  # can hold nothing but the bytes. It also answers the other half of the contract for
  # free: esc lands back on the RELATED row the viewer was opened from, same tab, same
  # cursor, because nothing underneath moved.
  #
  # That argument is why the LIVE mode goes through a Snapshot rather than through the
  # drill-in, even though a live flow HAS a live id to hand it: ↵ on a RELATED row is a
  # READ, and reading must not put a row of verbs that delete and send one keystroke from
  # the reader. `f` is the one action, and it only ever ADDS a copy.
  #
  # Read-only, so there is no `on_commit` and `handle_key` never answers :commit. Its two
  # actions hand OUT rather than change what is shown: `y` gives the pane's text to the
  # injected `on_copy` (the clipboard is the shell's — it writes to the tty — not this
  # card's), and `f`, LIVE only, asks the injected `on_freeze` to copy what is on screen
  # into the open issue's evidence. Neither edits a byte of the source.
