module Gori::Tui
  # The READ-mode edits of an editor pane: delete the selection, delete or yank whole lines,
  # and paste the register. The two keysets spell them differently (gori: `x` then `d` / `y`,
  # and `p`; vim: `dd`, `yy`, `⇧V` then `d` / `y`, and `p`), and this is the one engine both
  # spellings run.
  #
  # NO EDIT HAPPENS HERE DIRECTLY. Each operation enters INSERT through the pane's own
  # `editor_enter_insert`, hands the span to the editor, and then replays the keystroke a hand
  # would have typed: ⌫ over a selection to delete, a paste to insert. That is the point of
  # the module. The eight editor panes each do their own work after an edit (the Repeater
  # re-derives Content-Length and refuses a lone `§`, the Fuzzer guards its markers, a note
  # saves, the Project description marks itself dirty), and a READ-mode edit that spliced
  # the TextArea itself would skip all of it. Replayed this way, `d` is exactly "select it,
  # `i`, ⌫, `esc`", and `p` is exactly the bracketed paste the pane already takes (P7: the
  # bytes go in through the same path as the operator's own paste, with the same line-ending
  # rule).
  #
  # Pure over an `EditorPane` and a key sink, so it is spec-able without a terminal: the
  # Runner passes its own `handle_key`, a spec passes the controller's `handle_body_key`, and
  # the keyset playground's practice pad (`KeysetPad`) passes its own INSERT ladder.
  # Each operation returns the status line to show, or nil when the pane already said why.
