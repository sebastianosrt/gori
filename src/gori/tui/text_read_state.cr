    # THE hand-over seam: a read state whose selection anchor indexes a document that is no
    # longer the one on screen drops that selection, here, before it answers anything.
    #
    # The anchor is a (line, column) pair with no notion of which buffer it was made in. Two
    # owners hand this state a DIFFERENT document without going through it: Notes keeps one
    # read state for a strip of sub-tabs, each with its own `TextArea` (a `^2` swaps the
    # editor under the state), and every owner's peer reload / `^E` hand-back / project
    # switch replaces the bytes inside the same editor (`set_text`, `replace_from_outside`).
    # Either way the band was painted at the old coordinates over the new text, and `y` put
    # the wrong document's characters on the clipboard — the operator never selected in it.
    #
    # `IssuesView#open_detail_issue` states the rule ("the READ SELECTION, whose anchor
    # indexes the document being handed over") and fixed it at one caller with an explicit
    # `clear_selection`. That caller is still needed — a skip-if-unchanged seed hands over a
    # new row whose bytes match the old, which no counter can see — but a rule that each new
    # hand-over site has to remember is how this bug reached five of them. So the state keeps
    # the identity of the editor it last synced against and that editor's `edits` revision,
    # and treats a change in either as the hand-over. `edits` is the editor's own monotonic
    # content counter (every splice, `set_text`, `undo`); the read state moves the caret only
    # through `place_cursor` and the buffer-edge jumps, none of which bump it, so an unchanged
    # revision means exactly "the text the anchor was made in is still the text".
    #
    # Rebinding also re-syncs the caret from the editor: the old position may index past the
    # end of the new document, and every caller reads `@cursor` right after this.

    # --- the READ-mode over-paint ----------------------------------------------
    # The NORMAL-mode selection band + block caret, drawn on top of the frame the editor just
    # laid down. It lives HERE because all five owners of a read-mode editor — the Repeater's
    # request pane, the Fuzzer template, Notes, an Issue's notes, the Project description —
    # had grown their own copy of exactly this loop, and the copies had already drifted: two
    # measured the band on the raw line (blind to the concealed `¦chain` runs, see the
    # READ-mode over-paint seam in `text_area.cr`), one omitted the `sync_from` the other four
    # carry against a peer edit shrinking the buffer under a stale cursor, and every one of
    # them derived the screen row as `li - editor.scroll`.
    #
    # That last sum is what soft wrap retires. A wrapped logical line is N drawn rows, so
    # `li - scroll` names the row the line STARTS on and paints every one of its rows there —
    # the band and the caret drifting further off with each wrap above them. `last_rows` is
    # the row list the editor ACTUALLY drew, so inverting it cannot disagree with the draw.
    #
    # `rect` must be the same interior the editor was rendered into. Both the band and the
    # caret go through the EDITOR (`paint_read_band` / `read_caret_cell`), which owns the

    # AUTHORITATIVE in both directions: after this call the READ selection is exactly the INS
    # selection that existed at `esc` time, empty included. That is what keeps the round trip
    # honest — READ-select, `i`, type, `esc` must not resurrect the band from before the edit,
    # which a plain `sync_from` (it leaves the read anchor alone) would do. It is also why
    # RepeaterView#exit_request_insert! can route here instead of hard-clearing: the reason it
    # cleared was that an INS band is painted only while INS is on, so leaving the anchor set

    # visible instead, so there is no longer a hidden state to dismiss.
