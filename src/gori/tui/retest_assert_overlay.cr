  # The one expected result a retest step carries (#1036): a one-field card that TEACHES the
  # grammar while it is being typed and says, live, whether what is in the field parses.
  #
  # Not `NamePromptOverlay`, which is the shape this started as. That card's chrome is
  # written for a named library entry — its field is labelled `Name`, and its footer states
  # "an existing name is overwritten", which is simply false here. More importantly an
  # assertion is not a name the operator already knows: `json:data.role=admin` is a grammar
  # they are meeting, and the accepted forms have to be IN FRONT OF THEM while they type,
  # not folded into one truncated hint line.
  #
  # The validation is the other half. `Retest::Assertion.parse` already answers "why not" in
  # a sentence; showing it under the field as it is typed means a bad assertion is corrected
  # here rather than discovered as a step that silently asserts nothing.
