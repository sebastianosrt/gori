  # A caret-anchored autocomplete dropdown for `$ENV` variable references typed inside a
  # text editor (the Repeater request, the Fuzzer template, …). The owning TextArea computes
  # the token span under the caret + the rows that may replace it and feeds them via `set`;
  # this holds only the open/selection/scroll state and the rendering. Modelled on
  # ChainComplete, but anchored at the caret CELL (not a fixed field row) and showing a dim
  # value preview.
  #
  # TWO KINDS OF ROW, because the namespaced grammar has two stages. A `:ns` row inserts a
  # NAMESPACE opener (`$ENV.`) and leaves the popup open on the names inside it; a `:token`
  # row inserts a whole reference (`$ENV.HOST`) and closes. The bare grammar has one stage,
  # so it produces `:token` rows only and this renders exactly as it always did.
  #
  # Each row carries its OWN `replace_end`: a namespace row swallows the structural dot the
  # operator already typed (so `$EN|V.TOKEN` completes to `$ENV.TOKEN`, never `$ENV..TOKEN`)
  # while a token row on the same refresh replaces the whole `$NS.NAME` run. One span for
  # both kinds is what produced the double dot.
