  # The Discover sub-tab (under the Target parent tab). Spider + directory brute-force runs
  # are BACKGROUND jobs — starting one from a Sitemap/History space menu does NOT block;
  # progress shows on the bottom bar and completion posts a notification. Discovered
  # endpoints are persisted to the Store so they surface in the Sitemap. Modeled on
  # MinerController (start_run / drain_events / apply_event + the drain-before-rebind race
  # fix). Composed by TargetController, so it exposes frameless render_content /
  # handle_click_content seams instead of owning the tab frame.
  #
  # The body is two panes (RUNS list ↹ FINDINGS table): every launched run keeps a row, and
  # ^R/^X/p act on the SELECTED row, so a crawl started before the current one is still
  # reachable — see DiscoverView's note on what the single-card version cost.
