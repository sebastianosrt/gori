module Gori::Tui
  # Runs the user's statusline command and turns its stdout into a safe display
  # string. The genuinely new bit here is capturing stdout WITH a timeout — Crystal's
  # `Process.run` has none — so a hung script can never wedge the statusline (or, since
  # this runs on a worker fiber, the UI). Errors map to a short marker, never an
  # exception. Modeled on browser.cr's detached-reap + external_editor.cr's error mapping.
  module Statusline
    # Cap on stdout bytes read from the script. We only render the first line, so we
    # stop at the first newline anyway; this bound also protects against a runaway
    # command (`yes`, `cat /dev/zero`) ballooning memory before the timeout fires.

    # How long the empty-output path may wait for the child's exit status before giving
    # up on it. Only reached once stdout has already hit EOF, so in practice the status
    # is there already; the bound just means the pathological child (stdout closed, still
    # alive) costs one short pause rather than wedging the worker.

    # error, return a short marker instead of raising.
    #
    # Every path converges on one teardown: close stdout (so a reader fiber blocked in
    # `read` unblocks — critical when the command backgrounds a descendant that keeps the
    # pipe open), kill the child unless it has already been reaped, and reap it on a
    # detached fiber. This fiber never blocks on a bare `process.wait`, so a child still
