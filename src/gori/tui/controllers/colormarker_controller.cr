  # The Colormarker tab: two stacked panes. The POLICY list on top manages this project's
  # History row-colour rules (the shared Colormarker engine History's row loop reads live);
  # the CUSTOM COLORS list below manages the global palette of user-defined colours those rules
  # can paint with. Add/edit on either pane opens a modal (ColormarkerRuleOverlay /
  # CustomColorOverlay), wired in the runner like the Rewriter rule editor.
  #
  # Multi-pane like the Rewriter, and for the same reasons: `@focus` names the pane the keyboard
  # points at, the rule verbs' chords are gated on the policy pane being focused (a chord has no
  # `section:` to hide behind), and the colours pane's a/e/d are handled HERE rather than as
  # verbs — the two panes share `Verb::Scope::Colormarker`, and the keymap holds one verb per
  # chord per scope, so a/e/d could not bind twice.
