  # closed here; side A is another project, opened READ-ONLY for the length of one
  # comparison and closed again, so the tab never holds a second project open while the
  # operator reads the result (P8).

  # The comparison runs on demand (`r`, and on picking a side), never on the poll: it is a
  # second database open, and a report that silently re-ran under the cursor would move
  # rows out from under a click.
