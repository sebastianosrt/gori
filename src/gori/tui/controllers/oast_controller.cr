  # history) behind two fixed sub-tabs — Callbacks (default) and Providers — since both
  # sub-tabs are views of the SAME data (unlike Target, which composes two independent
  # child controllers). Listening is a background job: a poll fiber per session feeds the
  # `@oast_events` channel drained each tick; callbacks persist so history survives restart.
