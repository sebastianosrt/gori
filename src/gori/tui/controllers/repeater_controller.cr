    # input burst: no input, no render, no drain, terminal left in raw/alt mode — while the

    # leaves the pane showing the previous response as if nothing had been attempted. Applying

    # verbatim what the drain would have done on the same fiber (`view.apply` and friends are

    # hint shows a value for. So the expansion stays suppressed and the fact is stated.

    # half wired. `Sender#send_ws` used to expand `$NAME` in the handshake UNCONDITIONALLY —
    # it carried its own copy of `wire`'s two passes — so an evidence WS tab was substituting
    # where the very same tab's HTTP send had stopped. Routing it through `wire` closed that,

    # received` alone is gori claiming a clean exchange over bytes whose `$CTOK` was withheld.
