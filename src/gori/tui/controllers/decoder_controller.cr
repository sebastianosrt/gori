  # (scroll + display mode + the custom strip label, DecoderView#name, set by rename).
  # The controller holds an array of these; the transient overlays (the autocomplete
  # popup, the save/load mini-prompt, the in-flight IME preedit) stay controller-level
  # and act on the CURRENT session. `chain`/`chain_cx`/`result`/`pane` get reassigned,
  # so this is a mutable class, not a record.

  # plus a read-only PIPELINE notebook + OUTPUT, drawn by DecoderView. The body
  # consumes EVERY printable key (like Notes), so command_scope is the Decoder scope
  # and handle_body_key always returns true: the Decoder verbs' single-letter
  # mnemonics never collide with literal text (`:` stays literal) — they're reached
  # only from the space menu + palette. A runner-owned sub-tab strip appears from the
  # first session (^N new · ^W close · ^1-9/←→ switch · e rename); open sessions persist
  # to THIS project's store (`Store::DECODER_SESSIONS_KEY`), so switching projects opens a
  # clean workbench instead of carrying the previous engagement's material across. The
  # named chains a conversion can load stay in the global settings.json — a chain spec is
  # tool config, reusable everywhere; what was run THROUGH it is project data.
