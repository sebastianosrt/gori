  # PICK A PROVIDER: which of the enabled OAST providers an action that needs exactly ONE
  # should use, asked at the moment it needs the answer.
  #
  # The payload bar's provider slot has an "All" position, and "All" is a legible state for
  # the callbacks table (show every provider's hits) but not for `g` / `^R`, which mint or
  # register against ONE provider. Both used to answer that with a status line — "select a
  # specific provider (use ‹/› to cycle)" — which names a second, invisible step: the operator
  # pressed a key, got told no, and had to find a bar they were not looking at. This card
  # answers the same question where it was asked.
  #
  # A row is addressed by its ProviderConfig#key, never by index: the enabled list is re-formed
  # on every reload/soft-sync (a peer process toggling a provider is enough), so an index
  # captured when the card opened can point at a different provider by the time ↵ lands. The
  # key is the same identity `Listener#provider_key` and `listener_for` already run on.

    # provider gori is listening with mints its payload locally, with no round trip, and that
