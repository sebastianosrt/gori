  # identities, plus — for the selected request — the per-identity result table and a preview
  # of one identity's response. Session-only (no project DB, see AuthorizeController).
  #
  # Two-level like Burp Autorize / Caido: the top pane is one row per REQUEST with an aggregate
  # verdict; the bottom pane drills into the selected request's identities. `Tab` moves the
  # identity sub-cursor so each identity's response can be read.
  #
  # MVP ships two built-in identities — the request as-captured (baseline) and an anonymous one
  # that strips Cookie/Authorization — which already answers "is this endpoint protected at
  # all?". Custom identities are a follow-up.
