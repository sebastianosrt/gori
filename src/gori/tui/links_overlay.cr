  # Adding is a two-step flow (`a` arms it, then f/r/z/m picks a source) that opens a
  # SECOND modal — the flow or sub-tab picker. Pre-seam that round-trip lived in the
  # Runner as three ivars (@link_add_owner / @link_add_ref_kind plus the picker itself)
  # and a pair of close methods that rebuilt this overlay from scratch on every exit.
  # It now rides the base's nested-modal seam: a source key reports :cancel with
  # `pending_add` set, and the injected `on_close` puts the sub-picker up in this card's
  # place — the sub-picker's own `on_close` pops back to a fresh LINKS card, whichever
  # way it exits. The owner is already ours (`owner_kind`/`owner_id`), so none of that
  # pending-link state survives in Runner.
  #
  # Domain edges are injected at the open-site (Runner#open_links_overlay): `on_commit`
  # opens the selected link, `on_remove` deletes it, `on_close` drives the add hand-off.

    # `opening`, and on_close — pending_add still nil — ran navigate_link_ref, teleporting
    # the operator into an unrelated flow/repeater/fuzz while the armed add was silently
    # abandoned. While adding, the only meaningful input is f/r/z/m, so a click inside the

    # A click OUTSIDE still drops the whole card, deliberately NOT the one-level pop esc
    # does here. Click-away is the shell-wide dismiss gesture (Overlay#handle_click), and

    # handler cancels outright while capturing, where handle_capture_key's esc only leaves
    # capture. Making this the one modal whose outside click does not dismiss would cost
    # more consistency than the two depths do, and nothing leaks: pending_add stays nil, so
