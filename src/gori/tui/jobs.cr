  # feature (scans, big repeaters) can register a job.

  # INVARIANT: mutated ONLY on the main fiber, from the run loop's controller `drain_*`
  # methods. Background engine fibers never touch this; they push results through a
  # Channel the controller drains. So there are NO locks. Ephemeral per open project
  # (a fresh Runner is built per project), like repeater results.
