    # case, editing the body) rather than fading into a faint grey band. Inactive chips are
    # unfilled with a leading "N:" index dimmed (MUTED), a plain TEXT label, and a trailing
    # " #tag" run tinted (SYN_HEADER) so the eye lands on the label. `‹` / `›` flag overflow.
    # `hidden` (Repeater's tag filter) drops those absolute chip indices from the strip —
    # they keep their absolute number, so the visible chips read with gaps (2, 5, 7).
    # `marked` chips wear the `▌` bar below (and, when inactive, a SELECTION_DIM band).
    # `▌` on a marked chip (#683) — the same glyph History, Issues, Intercept, the Sitemap
    # and the project picker paint in their own left gutter, against the thinner `▎` those
    # lists use for the cursor. It goes in the chip's LEADING PAD COLUMN, which every chip
    # already has and no ink ever reaches (widths are `display_width + 2` and the label
    # starts at `seg.x + 1`), so a mark costs no columns and `strip_layout` — and with it
    # every click hit-test — is untouched. That it changes the chip's SHAPE rather than only
    # its colour is what makes a mark catchable at the edge of vision on a wide strip.
    #
    # `bg` is the surface the strip sits on: the canvas for a tab body, `Theme.panel` inside a
    # card (the Preferences modal). Every cell the strip paints that is not a pill takes it —
    # inactive labels, the `‹` / `›` markers, and the base the receded gold is blended over. A

    # overridden by a script — and a script that prints escape codes still owns its colours.
