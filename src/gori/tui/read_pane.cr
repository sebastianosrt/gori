  # A scrollable READ-ONLY text pane: the state (`ReadCursor` + vertical scroll + horizontal
  # scroll + last drawn height), the draw (gutter, h-slice, selection band, block caret, scroll
  # gauge) and every gesture (arrows, ⇧arrows, Home/End/PgUp/PgDn, wheel, click, drag,
  # double-click, select-line, copy) in one place.
  #
  # WHY THIS EXISTS. Three panes had already grown their own copy of exactly this — the Decoder
  # OUTPUT, the Fuzzer RESULT detail and the History detail — each ~90 lines of the same
  # arithmetic, and the drift between them was a real bug: `DecoderView#output_scroll_view`
  # clamped `cx` against the line the caret was LEAVING while `FuzzerView#detail_scroll_view`,
  # the same method over the same widget, clamped it against the line it lands on (and carried a
  # comment about the `IndexError` that costs). Six MORE panes are scrollable and readable today
  # with nothing selectable — Comparer, Miner detail, Sequencer analysis/detail, Probe detail,
  # OAST callback detail, the Intercept read-only preview, Rewriter preview-out — so the choice
  # was one home or nine.
  #
  # THE SOURCE IS `(size, line_at)`, NEVER AN ARRAY. `ReadCursor` carries both shapes and says
  # why: the lazy provider is what keeps caret moves, wheel notches and selection painting from
  # materialising every off-screen line of a multi-MiB body. The Intercept preview reads through
  # a `Highlight::Windowed`; a pane holding `Array(String)` would have to build one.
  #
  # The PLAIN text is what the caret addresses, the selection spans and a copy produces.
  # `styled_at` is an OPTIONAL second provider for the draw only — the Fuzzer detail's coloured
  # overlay, the Intercept preview's syntax highlighting — because the two must be allowed to
  # disagree about colour while agreeing exactly about columns. Where a pane has only styled
  # lines (the windowed message views), `Highlight.plain` is the bridge.
  #
  # `styled_at` must be COLOUR ONLY: its span texts have to concatenate back to the same line
  # `line_at` returns, which is `Highlight`'s own cardinal rule (see its header). The component
  # leans on it — the block caret paints `plain[cx]`, and that is the glyph the reader sees
  # precisely because the two agree. A provider that changed the characters would put a different
  # letter in the caret cell than in the row around it.

    #
    # `line_select_only` drops the horizontal half of the selection: ←/→ still move the caret,

    # An EMPTY pane answers true — the same choice `IssuesView#links_at_bottom?` makes, since a

    # arm of its own: `@size == 0` puts `last` at -1, which any caret clears, and `wrapping?`

    # `visual` is the half `at_top?` never needed a switch for, and it must match how the

    # steps LOGICAL lines, and asking the visual question there answers false on a wrapped
