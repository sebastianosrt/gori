  # Every modal state the shell's `@overlay` can hold. This was a bare `Symbol` with 33
  # values compared ~96 times across runner.cr, where one mistyped `:probe_rules` was a
  # silent no-op — an overlay that never opened, never rendered and never captured a key,
  # with no compiler help. As an enum the same typo is a compile error.
  #
  # Members keep the names the symbols had, so the mapping stays obvious: `ProbeRule` is the
  # Probe custom-rule editor and `Tabs` the tab-bar customizer. `None` is "no modal"; `Detail`
  # is the History drill-in, which is NOT a capturing modal (see Runner#modal_overlay?).
  #
  # `to_sym`/`from_sym` bridge the still-`Symbol` Host facade (TabController's
  # `request_overlay` / `overlay` / `confirm(return_to:)`). Both are TOTAL: `to_sym` is an
  # exhaustive `case … in`, so adding a member here fails to compile until it is mapped, and
  # `from_sym` raises rather than silently landing on `None` — a bad symbol at that seam must
  # be loud, since silence is the exact failure mode the enum exists to kill.

  # A centered modal overlay the shell floats above the tab body. The Runner owns ONE
  # active overlay (`@active_overlay`) and dispatches to it polymorphically — the same
  # move TabController made for tab bodies, now extended to modals.
  #
  # Before this seam, every modal scattered ~13 `case @overlay` entries through the
  # Runner (key / click / wheel / preedit / render / title / hint routing + open/close/
  # commit glue). That central fan-out was the merge-conflict surface: touching any one
  # modal meant editing a dozen shared methods 5,000 lines apart. An `Overlay` collapses
  # all of that into the hooks below, so ADDING or editing a modal touches only its own
  # file plus one open-site — never the Runner's central dispatch. Two overlays never
  # share an edit surface in runner.cr. That is the parallel-work win.
  #
  # Concrete overlays stay dumb form objects (their own field/caret state). Behaviour
  # that couples to a domain controller is injected as the `on_commit` closure at the
  # open-site — mirroring ConfirmDialog's action proc. A modal opened from two sites with
  # different apply semantics (e.g. Sequencer new-vs-reconfigure) therefore needs no
  # shell-side flag: each site supplies its own closure.
  #
  # Outcome vocabulary (returned by handle_key / handle_click), the contract the Runner's
  # generic dispatch switches on:
  #   :stay   → stay open, redraw
  #   :commit → run `commit`; the shell closes the overlay iff `commit` returns true
  #   :cancel → close without committing
  abstract class Overlay
    # The card geometry every ADD/EDIT-one-policy-rule form shares: Rewriter, Colormarker,
    # Probe custom, extract, Scope, OAST provider. They are the same kind of thing reached from
    # adjacent tabs, so opening two in a row must not resize the card under the operator — and
    # it did: the six had settled on 72, 72, 62, 72, 52 and 56, with floors ranging from 28×8
    # to 40×13, none of it derived from anything.
    #
    # 72 is the widest of them and the one three already used; it is what the Rewriter form
    # needed once a fifth op pushed its option row past the old 66. The narrower cards were not
    # narrower for a reason — a `pattern:` row holding a host glob or a regex wants the width
    # as much as any of them.
    #
    # HEIGHT is not a constant, because it depends on how many rows a form has: each computes
    # `rows + 4`, or `rows + 5` when it carries a preview band under the rows. That formula is
    # the thing to keep, not a number — two forms had drifted off it (one hard-coded 11 for
    # four rows, one asked for `+ 6`) and simply drew dead space above their own bottom edge.
    RULE_FORM_W     = 72
    RULE_FORM_MIN_W = 40
    RULE_FORM_MIN_H = 10

    # The card rect for one of those forms, centered in `area`. `rows` is the form's row count;
    # `preview` adds the band some of them draw under the rows.
    #
    # The floor is `min(RULE_FORM_MIN_H, natural)`, not the constant — a card is never refused
    # for being SHORTER than the form needs. Writing the constant straight into the guard is a
    # mistake worth naming, because it fails silently in exactly one direction: the Scope form
    # is four rows, so its natural height is 8, and a flat floor of 10 meant `overlay_box`
    # returned nil at every terminal size and the form could not be opened at all.
    def self.rule_form_box(area : Rect, rows : Int32, preview : Bool = false) : Rect?

    # One `label: value` row of such a form: the label in muted, the field's text (or its
    # live IME composition spliced in at the caret) clipped to the card, and — when the row
    # is selected and nothing is composing — the block caret plus the terminal cursor.
    #
    # It lives on the base class for the same reason `rule_form_box` does. The six forms had
    # each carried a byte-identical private copy of this, caret arithmetic and all: five
    # matched to the byte and OastProvider's differed only in parameter order. Six copies of
    # one caret calculation is six chances for the forms to disagree about where the cursor
    # sits, and the drift is invisible until an operator opens two of them in a row.
    #
    # `vw`'s floor of 3 and the `px < box.right - 2` guard are what keep a long label or a
    # narrow card from drawing the value — or the cursor — past the card's right border.

    #
    # This is the NESTED-MODAL seam. A modal opened FROM another supplies
    # `-> { open_overlay(parent) }` here, so closing pops back into the parent instead of
    # dropping the user on the bare tab body: ↵-ing into the Theme editor from Preferences
    # and pressing esc must land back in Preferences, not on the tab underneath. The shell
    # used to express exactly ONE such relationship, with a `@prefs_return` flag plus a
    # `settle_sub_editor` call at each dispatch chokepoint; as a per-overlay closure it
    # composes, so a modal can nest inside a modal that is itself nested.
    #
    # A proc rather than a parent reference, because the restore is not always just
    # "re-open the parent". Returning from the Hostnames editor has to re-pull the
    # Preferences modal's Network section first, whose "N entries" row that editor just
    # moved. A `return_to : Overlay?` cannot say that; a closure can.
    #
    # ORDERING, which is load-bearing: the shell drops the modal FIRST and runs this
    # after (see `Runner#close_active_overlay`), so a closure that calls `open_overlay` is
    # the last write and the shell really is holding the parent when it returns. An exit
    # that goes somewhere else entirely — ^P to the command palette — deliberately uses
    # `Runner#leave_overlay`, which skips this, so the pop-back can't re-open on top of
    # where the user asked to go.

    # The `@overlay` state this modal sets, written by `Runner#open_overlay`.

    # `active_overlay` instead. `key`'s real job is the liveness token in that method's
    # `@overlay == ov.key` gate — ~40 sites reset `@overlay` directly without clearing
