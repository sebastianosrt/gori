  # bytes the origin really sent, silently, with `Content-Length` re-synced behind it so
  # the loss leaves no trace. `gori run repeater <id>` and MCP `send_request` both replay
  # those bytes exactly; the TUI was the one surface that did not.
  #
  # So on an EVIDENCE tab markers start INERT and the operator declares them — by marking
  # (^A / ^T / insert §), the same explicit act the Fuzzer's ⇧I → ^A workflow already is.

  # not clear provenance — editing a header does not make the `§` in the body something the

  # on the commonest workflow there is (seed a capture, tweak a header, send).
  #
  # A restore()/reconcile lands undeclared: the persisted row carries the request text and
  # its `flow_id`, and nothing that says which `§` in it the operator typed. gori does not

  # the border, and a `^R` that would put `§…§` on the wire as literal bytes. The operator
