  # candidates), so on a group buffer it strips lines out of the operator's SECOND request
  # and reports them as headers removed from the first — meaningless whether or not gori
  # wrote the Content-Length. With `^L` off a whole-buffer `^R` is still a legitimate

  # PROVENANCE, the `%%%` half of `markers_live?` — and the reason that one is not enough.
  # `%%%` is draft syntax too: it means "split here" only because the OPERATOR typed it.
  # A capture whose body happens to hold a lone `%%%` line (a diff hunk, a delimiter, a
  # template fragment) is not two requests, and treating it as two produced the same three
  # faces the `§` defect did — the visible `Content-Length` covering only the pre-`%%%`
  # bytes while `^R` sent the whole 17, `^X` snapshotting that head into a byte-exact send,
  # and `space ▸ g` manufacturing a second request whose request LINE was the capture's own
  # `line2`. Nobody authored that request.
  #
  # Unlike `§` there is no marking VERB to declare with, so the declaration is the count:
  # a separator the buffer holds beyond the ones the capture arrived with is one the
  # operator typed. Same question as `markers_live?` ("did the operator author this
  # token?"), answered with the strongest signal this seam has. Once they add one the whole
  # buffer is a group draft, captured separators included — the honest reading, and visible
  # in the per-chunk Content-Lengths the reflection immediately writes.
  #
  # A draft is unaffected: `@evidence` is false, so every `%%%` in it splits as it always
  # has. A restore lands with the baseline set from the restored text, for the same reason
  # `@markers_declared` lands false — the row says nothing about who typed which line, and
  # when gori cannot know, evidence wins.

  # The reason a WHOLE-BUFFER send is refused, or nil.
  #
  # A buffer holding a live `%%%` is TWO documents in one: the operator wrote requests, and
  # `reflect_content_length_in_editor` writes each one's OWN Content-Length into it — the
  # numbers `space ▸ g` puts on the wire, and the only reading of that pane that means
  # anything (no request in it has a whole-buffer-sized body). `^R` and the `^X` snapshot
  # then read the same buffer WHOLE, and one number cannot be right for both framings:
  #
  #   pane      Content-Length: 3     ← chunk 1's body, "AAA"
  #   ^R        Content-Length: 60    ← re-synced by finalize_wire; self-consistent, but the
  #                                     pane never said 60 and the operator authored 2 requests
  #   ^X then ^R  Content-Length: 3 over a 60-byte body  ← hex sends the snapshot verbatim:
  #                                     a CL/body desync gori INVENTED out of a correct draft
  #
  # So the whole-buffer framing is the one that has no meaning here, and it is refused by
  # name rather than picked silently. The alternative — reflecting the whole-buffer number
  # instead — only moves the lie onto `g`, which this method's own neighbour already calls
  # "the worse way round for a tool whose whole job is telling the operator what it sent".
  #
  # Scoped to auto-CL ON, because that is exactly when gori has written a number of its
  # own. With `^L` off the pane, `^R` and `g` all carry the operator's numbers unchanged,
  # nothing is invented, and a literal `%%%` line in a body stays expressible — which is
  # why the message names `^L` as the second remedy and not just Send group. The route to Send
  # group is a `{space:…}` token: the view has no registry, so the controller that surfaces the
  # refusal expands it (`RepeaterController#chain_refusal`) and the letter is never typed here.
