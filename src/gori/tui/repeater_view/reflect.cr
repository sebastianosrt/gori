  # tab's command). A hook is by definition allowed to have side effects; typing is not a send.

  # Two failures, one guard. The first is mid-edit clobber: the reflection runs on every
  # keystroke, so the transient line a paste or a typed header produces —
  # `Content-Length: 4GET / HTTP/1.1`, the pasted header with the buffer's next line still
  # glued to its tail — matched the prefix and was replaced by `Content-Length: 53`, taking
  # `GET / HTTP/1.1` with it. Silently, and `Ctrl-Z` could not bring it back (see
  # `edit_undo`). Typing the header by hand in front of an existing one did the same to
  # whatever followed the caret.
  #
  # The second is that gori is a tool for sending requests an origin should not accept. A
  # `Content-Length: 0abc`, a `Content-Length: +5`, an empty one, an indented (obs-fold) one —
  # request-smuggling and desync primitives an operator types ON PURPOSE — and auto-CL quietly
  # correcting them means the test on screen is not the test on the wire. Auto-CL's job is
  # keeping an ordinary length honest while the body is edited; a value that is not a bare
  # number is a deliberate one, so it is left exactly as typed. (Surrounding OWS and leading
  # zeros are NOT in that set: `strip` runs before the digit test, so `  0005  ` is an ordinary
  # length and is kept honest. The rule is about the value's SHAPE, not its spelling.)
  #
  # A DUPLICATED Content-Length is deliberate too, and it is guarded one level down rather
  # than here: `resync_content_length` refuses the whole message when it finds two, so
  # `reflect_chunk_content_length`'s `synced == source` early return means this predicate is
  # never even reached for one.
  #
  # THE predicate lives in `Proxy::Codec::Http1`, because the WIRE has to apply the same
  # rule and did not: `resync_content_length` rewrote a `Content-Length: 0abc` that this
  # guard deliberately preserved, so the pane went on showing `0abc` while the socket got
