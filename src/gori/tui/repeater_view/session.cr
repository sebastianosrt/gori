  # The same request handed to a tab that reads `§…§` as TEMPLATE SYNTAX — `space ▸ f`
  # (Send to Fuzzer). Where this tab's markers are inert (a capture whose body legitimately
  # carries `§`; see `markers_live?`), the literal `§` are escaped to `§§` — the escape
  # `Fuzz::Template.parse` already defines — so the receiving template renders them back to
  # one `§` on the wire instead of turning the site's own text into an injection position
  # the operator never marked. Byte-identical to `request_text` in every other case, which
  # is every request without a `§` in it.
  #
  # Done over BYTES, not `String#gsub`: this request is a capture, so its body may hold
  # genuinely invalid UTF-8 (round 4's T1), and every String rebuild that walks chars
  # rewrites those bytes to U+FFFD — measured, on this very fixture, turning
  # `ff fe 01 02` into `ef bf bd ef bf bd 01 02` and inflating Content-Length with it.
  # The escape itself is `Fuzz::Template.escape_literal_markers`, not a second copy of the
  # loop: the OTHER road into a fuzz template — `FuzzerView#load`, ⇧I from History — escapes
  # at its own seam with that helper, and two spellings of one rule is the drift this branch
  # spent three round-trips removing for the `%%%` separator. Only the PROVENANCE question
  # (`markers_live?`) is ours; the byte rule belongs to the template.
  #
  # Each road escapes exactly once: `space ▸ f` goes runner/fuzzer.cr → here →
  # `FuzzerView#load_request`, which sets the text unescaped, so a captured `§` is never
  # doubled.
  # The `marker_bytes_in?` guard is LOAD-BEARING, not a redundant pre-check.
  # `escape_literal_markers` returns `raw` itself when there is no `§`, but `String.new(Bytes)`
  # always copies — so collapsing this to one line would copy the whole request buffer on
  # every marker-free `space ▸ f`, which is the overwhelmingly common seed and exactly the
  # allocation the helper's own comment says it avoids.

  # resynced `Content-Length` down to the shortened body, so nothing errored and the
  # smuggled `0\r\n\r\nGET /smuggled …` payload the operator was testing simply stopped
