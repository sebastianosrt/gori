# The FIELDS editor over a unary gRPC request payload (#828): pick a schema-known field,
# type a value, and the message is re-encoded around it with every other byte copied through.
# Reopens Gori::Tui::RepeaterView (see tui/repeater_view.cr).
#
# ## Why this is a FORM and not the tree
#
# `ProtobufTree` is a report: it lists every reading a payload fits and every note the lens
# has about it, on as many rows as that takes. This is a form — one row per field OCCURRENCE,
# each one either editable or carrying the reason it is not — because a row here has to map
# to a byte span the encoder can replace, and a note has no span.
#
# ## P7 holds: the schema is the lens, the bytes stay the truth
#
#   * Available only when a descriptor set resolves the rpc being SENT. With none loaded the
#     gRPC tab is exactly what it was — head as text, `^X` for the payload's bytes.
#   * A field number the message does not declare is listed, not hidden, and is not editable:
#     there is nothing to type it as. Same for a field whose wire type the schema contradicts
#     — the row names the disagreement, and `^X` is still the way to change those octets.
#   * Every byte outside the edited field is COPIED (`Protobuf::Encoder.replace`), so an edit
#     cannot quietly normalize an undeclared field, a group, or a truncated tail.
#   * `^X` remains reachable and remains the way to send something the schema calls impossible.

  # `Encoder.seed` answers the ROUND-TRIP question — "does this text re-encode to exactly

  # `bytes` field routinely carries an image, a nested serialized message or a signed blob,
  # and hex is three characters per octet: a 256 KiB payload seeds 786,431 characters into a
  # ONE-LINE editor that re-slices the whole string on every keystroke and repaints it every
  # frame. The same is true of a `string` field holding a document.
  #
  # So this is the third reading with no one-line form, beside a packed run past
  # `Lens::PACKED_MAX` and a string carrying control bytes: read-only, with the reason on the
  # row and `^X` beside it. The cap lives HERE and not in `Encoder.seed`, because the
