    # the body and showed the operator bytes that had never existed anywhere. Worse, hex
    # mode deliberately disables auto-Content-Length, so those invented bytes shipped under
    # the head's older, shorter CL and the remainder was left on the socket for the origin
    # to read as the front of the next request — gori desyncing its own connection while
    # reporting `✓ sent`. Hex mode is the documented byte-exact escape hatch; it has to
    # start from the bytes.

    # made ^X a peek that changed the wire: the pane showed, and hex-mode ^R sent, a bare-LF
