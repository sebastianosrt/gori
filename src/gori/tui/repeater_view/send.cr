  # a capture's `$filter`/`$top`/`$where`/`$IFS`/`$user.name` are bytes the origin sent,

  # precisely what `Repeater::PlanOptions#evidence?` and `FuzzerView#evidence_template`
  # already say for the same bytes on every other surface. The CRLF promotion is kept and
  # done explicitly because `TextArea#insert_newline` gives a typed line a bare LF and
  # names `expand_wire` as what promotes it — shipping one inside a head is itself a

  # and evidence wins when it cannot. `$$` escapes to a literal `$` on every path already,
  # so the operator has a spelling for either intent.
