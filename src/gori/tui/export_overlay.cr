module Gori::Tui
  # Centered popup collecting the DESTINATION path for an export — Notes → "Export note"
  # and Issues → "Export issues". One path field with an inline PathComplete dropdown:
  # ImportOverlay's form, pointed the other way.
  #
  # Two callers share it because the form is identical and everything that differs (card
  # title, blurb, prefill, toast noun) is the `kind` axis ImportOverlay already models. The
  # WRITE itself rides in as the `on_commit` closure supplied by Runner#open_export, so
  # neither controller learns that a modal exists.
  #
  # NOT a subclass of ImportOverlay, and no shared PathFieldOverlay base was extracted:
  # Crystal has no `override`, so a subclass silently shadows a base contract method, and
  # the two forms validate in OPPOSITE directions — import demands the file exist, export
  # demands it be writable and NOT (silently) exist. If a fourth path form ever appears,
  # extracting the field + dropdown + box geometry is the refactor to make then.
  #
  # It defines no handle_click for the same reason ImportOverlay doesn't: the one field is
  # always focused, so the base default (click inside → stay, outside → dismiss) already IS
  # this form's behaviour.
