  # The NEW / EDIT ISSUE modal: one title line plus a severity cycler. A dumb form —
  # the store write rides in as the `on_commit` closure the open-site injects
  # (Runner#open_issue_form → create_issue_from_form), so the same card serves the
  # standalone create, the create-and-link from a workbench picker, and the re-title of
  # an already-open issue.
  #
  # `link_ref` is the workbench item the create should also link to. It is captured HERE
  # rather than read off the shell at commit time so that dropping the form drops the
  # pending link with it: a cancelled create-and-link can no longer leave a stale ref
  # behind for a later standalone create to silently attach.
  #
  # The `cvss` row is a LAUNCHER, not a third text field: it shows what the issue will carry
  # and `↵` opens the calculator (CvssCalculatorOverlay), which is where a vector is both
  # typed and built. It began as a text field with a `^C` chord next to it, and both halves
  # of that were wrong. `^C` is the quit chord everywhere else in gori — the modal seam is
  # the ONE place it is free, so binding it here taught the reflex "^C leaves" a silent
  # exception. And a form whose ↵ means "create" cannot also mean "open the thing", so the
  # typing row and the builder were two editable copies of one value a row apart. One value,
  # one place to edit it, and `↵` keeps meaning "go on" rather than a chord you have to know.
