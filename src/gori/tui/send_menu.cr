module Gori::Tui
  # The catalog of destinations the "Send selection to…" picker (space → S) offers:
  # string-handling tools that accept a raw selected string as their input. The
  # SendPicker overlay renders these rows; the picker's injected commit routes the
  # chosen one's `tab` to that controller's seeding method. No TUI/state deps, so the
  # list stays a single trivially-extensible source of truth. The letters are the shared
  # `Verb::TOOL_LETTERS`, the same ones the "Send flow to…" family draws (#1274).
  #
  # Adding a target later (e.g. an Encryption tab) is one line here plus a `when :<tab>`
  # branch in the commit closure at Runner#send_to_open — no other wiring.
  module SendMenu
    # One offered destination: the row `label`, its mnemonic `key` (unique within the
    # list — the picker dispatches on it), the `tab` symbol the Runner routes to, and
    # a short muted `hint` describing what the target does with the string.
    record Destination, label : String, key : Char, tab : Symbol, hint : String

    # The current string-handling destinations, in display order. First (and only)
    # target for now is the Decoder — the selection becomes a new conversion's input.
