  # A caret-anchored, single-row tooltip that reveals the resolved value of the
  # `$KEY` env token UNDER THE CURSOR — the read-mode (and past-typing) counterpart
  # to EnvComplete's typing-time autocomplete. The owning TextArea resolves the
  # {label, value} for the REGISTERED token spanning the caret and feeds it via `set`
  # (an unknown `$word` gets no peek); this holds only open state + rendering.
  # Non-interactive (no selection or accept): a pure value peek. Anchored at the
  # caret CELL, like EnvComplete.
  #
  # The label arrives fully SPELLED (`$ENV.HOST` / `$HOST` — `Env.spell`), never as a bare
  # name this would prepend a sigil to: which namespace a token names is part of what the
  # peek is answering, and a tooltip that dropped it would read identically for the env var
  # and the binding of the same name.
