  # the next stray motion would extend a selection the operator had moved on from.

  # the drag just built on the clipboard — the primary-selection gesture a terminal gives you
  # natively, and the one gori took away by claiming the mouse in the first place.
  #
  # Three guards, all load-bearing. A plain CLICK ends in a release too, and `read_copy` with
  # nothing selected copies the WHOLE PANE (`read_selection_active? ? x_copy : x_copy_all`) —
  # so without `@dragging` every click would dump the pane to the clipboard, and without
  # `read_selection_active?` a press-and-jiggle that selected nothing would do the same.
  #
  # The third is `active_overlay`, and it is about WHOSE band this is. `dispatch_drag` resolves
  # the migrated overlay FIRST, so a drag inside one extends that modal's own `TextField` /
  # `TextArea` — while `read_selection_active?` / `read_copy` dispatch on `@active_tab` and
  # cannot see it. A copy on that release would not be the band the operator just dragged: it
  # would be whatever selection the tab UNDERNEATH still had (a Repeater REQUEST band left live
  # before opening a modal, say), announced in a toast as though it were. Written as a guard
  # rather than as a fix for something observed — driving the built TUI, no modal was found
  # whose `supports_drag?` press actually armed `@dragging` — but the two dispatches disagree
  # about who owns a drag, and only one of them is allowed to end in a clipboard write.
  #
  # The History detail is deliberately NOT excluded by this: it is the `@overlay.detail?` enum
  # state, not an `active_overlay`, which is why `read_copy` has an arm for it and why a drag
  # there copies (verified against the built binary).
  #
