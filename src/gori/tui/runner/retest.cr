# Issue-linked retest (#1036) — reopens Gori::Tui::Runner (see tui/runner.cr for the event
# loop, Host facade, overlays and rendering).
#
# The RETEST card is a modal opened from the Issues detail. Every domain edge is injected
# here, so the card itself never touches the Store: adding a step (a Repeater picker, then a
# role picker, then the assertion prompt), editing one, reordering, removing, running, and
# opening the History flow one result row recorded.
#
# Each hand-off rides the base's nested-modal seam (`Overlay#on_close`) rather than a
# shell-side flag: a key arms `pending`, the shell drops the card, and `on_close` puts the
# next modal up in its place — the pattern `open_links_overlay` documents. The chain always
# ends by REOPENING this card at the cursor it left, so a three-step add does not feel like
# three separate errands.
