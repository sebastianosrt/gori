# Frozen issue evidence (#1038) — reopens Gori::Tui::Runner (see tui/runner.cr for the
# event loop, Host facade, overlays, and rendering). Every entry point that freezes an
# exchange lands here: the Issues detail's RELATED row, the LINKS card's `f`, the LINK
# picker from History / the History detail / the Repeater, its "+ New issue…" row, and
# History's "Add issue". One snapshot builder, one pair of gates, one write.
#
# There is no "Link & freeze…" verb any more. Choosing between a pointer and the bytes made
# the operator understand an implementation detail (a link is mutable, retention and the next
# send can hollow it out) at the moment of FILING, and the answer was almost always "keep the
# bytes" — so ↵ on an issue freezes whenever the ref has an exchange, and says so when it
# cannot. The link is the primary act: a refusal, a declined gate or a quota wall changes what
# is KEPT, never whether the link happened, and the toast accounts for both halves.
