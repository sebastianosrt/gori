#
# The module under `src/gori/external_open.cr` is pure: it decodes, names, writes and prunes.
# Everything that touches a PROCESS is here, which is the split `run_external_editor` already
# draws — except that this one does NOT suspend the terminal. `open` / `xdg-open` hand the path
# to the desktop and exit immediately; they read no stdin and paint no screen, so leaving the
# alt-screen for them would flash the terminal for nothing and cost a full repaint.
