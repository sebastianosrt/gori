  # --- bracketed paste, in bulk -------------------------------------------
  #
  # A paste used to arrive as N ordinary keystrokes, and every one of them paid a full edit
  # cycle: an undo snapshot, a highlight invalidation, the Repeater's Content-Length
  # reflection over the whole buffer, a frame. Measured on this build: 8 KB took 3.2s and a
  # 244 KB request several MINUTES, slowing as it went — quadratic in the paste, on the
  # single commonest way a request gets into the tool. Buffered here and inserted once, the
  # cost is proportional to the paste.
  #
  # Only the BODY editor of a tab that says it can take one is eligible: everything else
  # (bottom prompts, pickers, overlays, single-line fields, hex edit) keeps the old
  # per-keystroke path, which is exactly what those surfaces already handle correctly.
  # The context in which a paste belongs to the tab BODY at all: no modal over it, no bottom
  # prompt, no floating picker — each of those owns its own keymap, and a paste inside one is
  # contained there. ONE home, because both decisions taken at a paste's start transition need
  # exactly this set and the second one arrived as a copy of the first.
  private def paste_body_context? : Bool

  # A bracketed paste arriving at an editor pane that is in READ opens it first (#1124).
  #
  # `i` then ⌘V was the documented recovery — `PASTE_REFUSED` says so in as many words — and
  # it lands in exactly the state this does: INSERT, caret where READ left it, the clipboard
  # spliced there. So this removes a keystroke from a two-step the operator was going to take
  # anyway; it does not invent a destination for the text. A paste is an explicit "put this in
  # the buffer", which is why it may arm an editor that a POINTER gesture deliberately may not.
  #
  # Called BEFORE the two questions below rather than folded into either, because it has to
  # change the answer to both: with the pane now in INSERT, `begin_bulk_paste?` takes the
  # bulk-capable editors (Notes, the Repeater request, the Fuzzer template, and the Decoder /
  # JWT / Cookie multi-line inputs) and `paste_runs_as_commands?` stops refusing the rest (the
  # Issue notes, the Project description, the single-line TARGET, CHAIN, SECRET and SALT rows),
  # which then get the per-keystroke path they already use in INSERT. Neither predicate needed
  # a new clause.
  #
  # The guards are `paste_body_context?` — shared with `begin_bulk_paste?` — plus
  # `subtab_filter_editing?`: a paste into the sub-tab `/` bar belongs to the bar, and arming
  # the editor underneath it would put the clipboard in two places at once. `editor_read_mode?` is derived from `body_badge`, so a
  # pane whose keys are already captured some other way — the Repeater's hex editor, its
  # `^Q` chain modal, the gRPC FIELDS form — reports INSERT here and is left alone.

  # without a word is its own bug report. Since #1124 an editor pane in READ is opened rather

  # text at all: the tab bar, the sub-tab strip, a list body.

  # --- a paste whose END MARKER never came ---------------------------------
  #
  # Everything above keys off the two `pasting?` transitions, so a paste that never ends
  # never resolves — and mid-paste BOTH branches eat the keyboard: `@paste_buf` swallows
  # each keystroke into a bulk insert that is never flushed, and `@paste_dropped` discards
  # them outright. The render loop is untouched, so the clock keeps ticking and the badge
  # keeps saying EDITOR while nothing typed has any effect. It reads as a hung app, and it
  # is not recoverable by any key, because keys are what is being swallowed.
  #
  # A terminal can genuinely fail to send `\e[201~` (killed mid-transfer, a dropped ssh
  # session, DEC 2004 switched off under us), and a parser can lose it: termisu did, on
  # every paste, because its end-marker probe skipped the fd whenever the poll budget was
  # spent and the budget is 0 on the very drain its own input source uses (fixed upstream —
  # `read_paste_end_tail`). One dependency bug in the input layer should not be able to
  # present as a dead keyboard, so the state is bounded here regardless of the cause.
  #
  # WHEN to give up is `PasteStall`'s decision, and it lives in its own object rather than
  # inline here because it is the delicate part and `run` needs a tty. Read its comments
  # before touching the re-arm rule — the first version aborted pastes on their opening tick.

  # Shown when the watchdog closed a paste and text really did land. A paste cut short may be
  # incomplete, so (unlike one that simply worked) the operator has reason to look at it.
  PASTE_UNTERMINATED = "paste ended without its end marker — inserted what arrived"

  # Shown when the watchdog closed a paste that was being REFUSED. Nothing was inserted, so
  # "inserted what arrived" would send the operator hunting for text that was deliberately
  # discarded; this names the same recovery `PASTE_REFUSED` does.
  PASTE_UNTERMINATED_REFUSED = "paste ended without its end marker — nothing focused took it"

  # Shown when the paste's marker was the only thing that ever arrived. Distinct from the two
  # above on purpose: at an editor that WOULD have taken the text, "nothing focused took it" is
  # a false accusation, and "inserted what arrived" is a false promise.
  PASTE_UNTERMINATED_EMPTY = "paste ended without its end marker — no content arrived"

  # THE one place a paste's state is torn down, called by BOTH exits: the end marker (in

  # and not the other yields a paste that closes correctly by marker and wrongly by timeout.

  # report, Escape itself — is probed as a possible end marker for a full second and then

  # Pasting a request into the Repeater's REQUEST pane in READ mode ran `POST /log` as
  # commands until the `i` of "/login" flipped the pane to INSERT, then typed the rest into

  # Pasting the same thing at the tab bar ran the global breath keys: `i` turned INTERCEPT
  # ON, so every subsequent request through the proxy was held, with nothing on screen
  # connecting that to a paste. `c` toggles capture and `q` leaves the project from there.
  #
  # The test is deliberately NARROW, and errs toward delivering the paste: everything modal
  # owns its own keymap and a stray paste inside it is contained, so only the surfaces that
  # reach the SHELL's keymap answer true — the tab bar, the sub-tab strip, a body that is not
  # currently an editor, and the space menu and its two pickers. Those three are NOT
  # containers: the paste's first key runs a row or closes them, and the rest reach the
  # tab's keymap (`Space` then a pasted `zc` stopped capture). `:detail` is in that set for the same reason
  # `drag_press_target?` puts it there: it is a History body drill-in, not a capturing modal,
