#
# The LIST is edited in the Authorize tab's identities card (`runner/authorize.cr`) — an
# Authorize identity IS a session slot, one list and one settings row. What lives here is the
# other half: the ACTIVE pointer, which is what `Repeater::Sender`, `Fuzz::Sender` and the
# intercept forward consult through `Env.overlay_slot`, and which the `session:` top-bar chip
# reports. It is memory-only by design (`SessionSlots`), so this writes nothing.

  # filterable name + detail list whose `on_commit` is injected by the open-site — and a slot
  # list can be long enough that typing two letters of the name beats scrolling.
  #
  # Row 0 is ALWAYS `as captured`, even when the project has no slots. It is not a placeholder:
  # deactivating is the way back to sending a request under its own session, and a picker that
  # can only ever ADD an overlay would leave the operator no way out but restarting gori.
