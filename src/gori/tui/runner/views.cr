# A view is a named QL query the History list ANDs over the filter bar, the way the `s` scope
# lens does. `SavedViews` owns the model and the two stores; what lives here is the TUI's whole
# editing surface for them, and it is deliberately overlays-only — no tab, no form.
#
# The editing model is "the filter bar IS the editor". A view is BORN from a filter the operator
# already typed and can see (`+ Save current filter…`), and it is edited by loading it back into
# that same bar (`^E`) and re-saving under the same name. That is why there is no query field
# anywhere here: a second place to write a QL query would be a second place for it to be wrong,
# with none of the bar's completion, highlighting or live row count.
