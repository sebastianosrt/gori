  # after the insert — so marking 5 flows and pressing ⇧F files one finding with five samples,
  # not five issues.

  # And the bytes go with it (#1038). This is the most-used filing path in the program, so it
  # follows the same rule "Link…" does: what proved the finding is COPIED, not only pointed
  # at. The copies are taken and their gates answered BEFORE the form opens — the operator is
  # about to spend a minute on a title, and an exchange can change underneath it — then handed
  # to the form, which writes them once the issue exists. A pending flow is attached exactly
  # as it is today; it simply has no bytes to keep.
