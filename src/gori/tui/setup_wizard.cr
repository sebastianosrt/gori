module Gori::Tui
  # The first-run setup wizard: a standalone, full-screen, step-by-step TUI that
  # helps a brand-new user configure gori before the project picker. Auto-launched
  # once (App#run_tui, when settings.json doesn't exist yet) and re-runnable via
  # `gori wizard`. A config-only tool — no Session/proxy/CA — so it just edits the
  # global Settings + live Theme, mirroring ProjectPicker's run-loop/render shape.
  #
  # Steps: NETWORK (bind ip/port) → THEME (list + live preview) → COMPANION (Miss Ring) →
  # REVIEW (recap + finish).
  #
  # Edits are STAGED in wizard-local fields and committed to Settings only on
  # finish, so "skip" (Esc) is coherent: it reverts the live theme preview to the
  # baseline, leaves Settings untouched, and persists once (materializing
  # settings.json so the wizard never auto-launches again).

    # without bumping its constant here draws straight over the card's bottom border, and one
    # row added to REVIEW raises the real floor above the "min 40x15" the guard advertises.
