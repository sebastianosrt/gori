module Gori::Tui
  # Miss Ring — the mascot in the bottom-right of the tab body. Owns WHEN she moves and
  # what she says; Mascot owns how she looks.
  #
  # IDLE-ZERO-CPU. The run loop only repaints when something reports `dirty`, so an
  # always-animating widget would defeat the design it lives in. Three layers keep that
  # honest:
  #
  #   1. She can be switched OFF, and then #tick returns false on its first line, exactly
  #      like a disabled ResourceMeter. She SHIPS ON now (Settings::DEFAULT_COMPANION), so
  #      this is no longer the default install's path and 2 and 3 are what carry it —
  #      but it is still the whole answer for anyone who says no, and motion "still" is
  #      the same zero for someone who wants her face and none of the cost.
  #   2. She DOZES. After SLEEP_AFTER with no key, no click and no notification she
  #      freezes into one static frame and #tick returns false forever — an unattended
  #      gori is back to genuinely zero animation work. #poke re-arms her.
  #   3. Even awake, #tick reports a change only when the frame that would be DRAWN
  #      differs — roughly 1 repaint/second on "lively", 0.3 on "calm", each forwarding
  #      a handful of changed cells through the backend's diff. That is what a default
  #      install now pays while someone is at the keyboard, and it is small: .draw costs
  #      7.8µs idle against the 218µs a body wipe already costs on the same frame
  #      (bench/companion_draw_bench.cr, M-series, --release).
  #
  # SINGLE FIBER, NO LOCKS — the same invariant Notifications documents. #tick runs on
  # the render loop, #poke on the input handler, .draw on render; all the main fiber. The
  # engines push notes from their own fibers into channels that the MAIN fiber drains, so
  # a controller worker must never touch a Companion.

    # …but a gesture fires in only one window in GESTURE_ODDS, so she plays one about every
    # 25 seconds and any PARTICULAR one about every three minutes. Still rare per gesture —
    # the blink is what she does, and a gesture only reads as one if it is not the norm —
    # but the RATE is sized against SLEEP_AFTER rather than against taste alone: she dozes
    # after 90 seconds, so at the old one-per-75s an operator who stepped away saw a single
    # gesture per waking spell, and the table might as well have had one entry in it.

    # before the eyes shut.
    #
    # EVERY POSE HERE LIVES IN THE CAVITY (brows + eyes + mouth), which is the constraint
    # that picked them: Mascot.draw_row paints the middle row alone, so a gesture expressed
    # in the badge, the glint or the shake is invisible to everyone running `placement =
    # bar`. The brows are part of that vocabulary — the last three scripts are told apart
    # from the first four as much by which way the lashes lean as by the eyes.
    #
    # SEVEN AND NOT MORE, because the table is bounded by what the OPENING can show rather
    # than by what reads well: @beat starts at 0 in every process, so the first firings are
    # the same fixed sequence for every user, and a spec pins that they cover the whole
    # table. Ten firings fit in the sweep, so seven scripts leave slack to choose a salt on

    # 36 wide — against which the sprite plus its gutter is 11 columns. MIN_W is therefore a

    # That last column is the whole reason this is 3 and not 2. Companion.draw claims a column of
    # plate either side of the sprite, so the box it actually paints is Mascot::W + 2 wide,
    # not Mascot::W — and a gutter sized for the sprite alone put the right strip exactly on
