  # frame, dwarfing gori's own draw code at ~15 µs) — this accumulates the frame into
  # its own cell grid and, on `flush`, forwards ONLY the cells that changed since the
  # last frame. That collapses the per-frame `fill`-then-draw double write into one
  # write per net-changed cell and skips every unchanged cell (the whole chrome during
  # a body-only scroll; the whole screen during a spinner / clock / cursor tick),

    #
    # There used to be a second floored measure, `column_width`, which walked CODEPOINTS
    # instead of clusters to serve a per-codepoint caret. The two agreed on ASCII, tabs and
    # precomposed CJK and diverged only on a multi-codepoint cluster, where `column_width`
    # over-counted every codepoint past the first:
    #
    #   "a\tb"     display_width 2   (was column_width 3)    draw_width 3
    #   "👍🏽"       display_width 2   (was column_width 3)    draw_width 2   (skin tone)
    #   "👨‍👩‍👧‍👦"    display_width 2   (was column_width 11)   draw_width 2   (3 ZWJ)
    #   "한글" NFD  display_width 4   (was column_width 8)    draw_width 4   (6 jamo)
    #
    # Keeping both is what made #278 (tabs) and #285 (emoji) trade off against each other,
    # and it painted a DUPLICATE glyph past any decomposed text: the caret advanced 8
    # columns over NFD "한글" while the draw advanced 4, so `value[@cx]` was stamped four
    # cells right of where the glyph ended. `draw_width` SUBSUMES the old measure — every
    # property `column_width` existed for survives, because `grapheme_cols` still floors to
    # ≥1 and a control char, a tab and a zero-width `U+200B`/`U+FEFF` are each their own
    # cluster — so the caret model moved onto clusters (see `column_for`, `cluster_start`)
    # and the codepoint measure is gone. `display_width` remains, and remains DIFFERENT: it
