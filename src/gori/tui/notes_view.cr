  # The Notes tab (DESIGN.md §6: notes/report — the running scratchpad/report).
  # Multiple free-form, per-project documents kept as sub-tabs (like Repeater):
  # `^N` opens a new note, `^W` closes the current one, `^1-9` switches. Each
  # note defaults to READ (navigate/select/copy); i/↵ enters INS to type. The whole set
  # is persisted in the project's settings KV as JSON (key "notes.docs") and
  # saved when you leave the editor, so it survives reopening the project.
  #
  # Backward compatibility: a project written by the single-note build stored a
  # plain-text document under the key "notes". On first load (when "notes.docs"
  # is absent) that legacy value is migrated into the first note; the new JSON
  # key is written on the next save (the legacy key is left untouched, harmless).
