  # A type-to-filter picker over a tab's sub-tabs — search the open sessions by
  # their chip label / request line, ↑/↓ select, ↵ jump to the chosen one. The
  # structural twin of FlowPicker (in-memory substring filter, IME preedit,
  # selection-follow scroll, mouse hit-test) but lists sub-tabs instead of flows.
  # Generic over any sub-tab strip (only Repeater wires it today).
  #
  # A dumb form object on the Overlay seam: the pick's effect is the injected
  # `on_commit`, so one picker serves both sub-tab search (jump to the session,
  # Runner#subtab_search_open) and the entity-link flow (attach the repeater/fuzz/miner
  # session to an issue or note, opened as a child of LinksOverlay).
  class SubtabPicker < FilterPickerOverlay
    # `index` is the sub-tab's absolute position — the value handed back on commit;
    # `label` is the chip text, `detail` the dim searchable request line. `extra` is
    # searched but never drawn — request/template content far too long for a column
    # (TabController#subtab_search_extras fills it, capped at SEARCH_EXTRA_MAX).

    # heading and the focus badge. Intended here — but a field quietly satisfying an
    # abstract method is a real hazard in Crystal (no `override`), so it is spelled out.
