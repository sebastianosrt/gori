      # The extra reason is that the Project tab's ENV pane read-modify-WRITES the whole array
      # (`Env.save_project` persists it wholesale, from the copy `ProjectView#reload` took of
      # this global), so a stale copy did not just READ wrong — the next edit in the pane wrote

    end

    # The quit POLICY — ONE function, consumed by BOTH entry points (`handle_key`'s ^C/^D and
    # `quit!`, which the palette's "Quit gori" verb dispatches). They diverged once, and that
    # was the bug: the chord honoured `Settings.confirm_quit?` while the palette — the only
    # discoverable Quit in the app — went straight to the teardown, so the opt-in "require a
    # confirm modal to quit" was silently ignored on the one path an operator can find.
    #
    # `chord` is "this request was a single keystroke". Only a keystroke can Arm: the arm is a
    # typo guard for a chord that sits under the fingers, and its toast names ^D/^C — which a
    # palette operator never pressed. ^P → filter → ↵ on a row reading "Quit gori" is already
    # the deliberate second act the arm is asking for, so a non-chord request quits outright.
    #
    # With the setting ON the answer is Confirm regardless of `armed` and regardless of whether
    # any job is live: the setting's own text is unconditional, `quit_confirm_message(nil, 0)`
    # is written for the idle case, and a guarantee that only holds while a job happens to be
    # running is not a guarantee. (Quitting idle still commits pending edits and drops the
    # session, so there is something to be asked about.)
    #
    # Pure + class-level for the same reason the exit prompts above are: the Runner needs a
    # live tty. `@overlay.confirm?` deliberately stays at the chord's call site — "don't stack a
    # second modal on the one already asking this question" is dispatch, not policy.

      # fine for a quit that only drops a session; it is not fine for one that drops a writeup
      # a peer's rewrite has already made unsaveable. "Confirm before quit" is a preference

    # Does the shell's pre-filter claim ^C/^D for the global quit arm, or does it YIELD them
    # to the modal that is up?
    #
    # It used to claim them unconditionally, ahead of overlay dispatch, which made every
    # modal's own use of the chord unreachable. The Fuzzer's payload-set editor advertises
    # "^D favorite" on its wordlist row and handles `ev.ctrl_d?` on the Path field
    # (fuzz_set_overlay.cr), but ^D armed a quit and a second ^D EXITED gori — discarding a
    # half-composed set that `commit_pending_edits` does not cover — while the status bar and
    # the card showed two contradictory hints at once.
    #
    # WHAT STILL GUARANTEES AN EXIT, which is the reason this yield is safe: every one of the
    # `Overlay` subclasses handles `escape?`, and the base `Overlay#handle_click` dismisses on
    # any click outside the card. So the chord is yielded only into states that are themselves
    # always closable, and the arm is one `esc` away — an operator can never be held inside a
    # modal by this. The invariant is worth keeping true: an overlay added later that swallows
    # esc would, for the first time, be able to hold the quit chord hostage.
    #
    # SCOPE — deliberately the `active_overlay` seam and nothing else. The Palette, the ⋯
    # dropdown (MODAL_OVERLAYS, no Overlay object) and the prompt-tier strips (space menu,
    # copy-as, send-to, ^G goto, ^F find, rename, tag-edit) keep the old behaviour: none of
    # them has anything that could answer for the chord, so yielding there would only make ^D
    # a dead key. This is the seam `Overlay#raw_key_capture?` is read from, generalized rather

    # measured on a real `$EDITOR` session via tmux pane flags: `alternate_on=0` while
    # `mouse_any_flag=1` and `mouse_sgr_flag=1`. The child inherits this tty
    # (`Process::Redirect::Inherit`), so a click or a scroll wheel arrives in ITS stdin as an
    # SGR report — `\e[<0;40;12M`. For `ExternalEditor::WIRE_KINDS` (:request, :intercept)
    # whatever the editor saves becomes the operator's WIRE BYTES, so a stray mouse report is
    # a byte-exactness violation: gori would send bytes nobody typed.

    # is currently redundant — but omarluq/termisu#167 is still open, and shard.yml plans to
    # go back to upstream once the fork's patches land. Deleting it before that merges would
    # regress silently the moment we switch. DELETE THIS (and its spec) then, not now. It
    # costs nothing meanwhile: both calls guard on `@mouse_enabled`, so the doubled disable
    # is one no-op.
