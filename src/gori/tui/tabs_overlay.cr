  # Overlay editor for the top tab bar (settings:tabs): which tabs sit on the bar and in what
  # order. Edits a WORKING COPY — committed on ↵, discarded on esc — like the settings:*
  # family, so the live bar underneath stays put while you edit. Rows are the FULL catalog
  # (the off-bar ones too, so they can be traded back in), reconciled against
  # Settings.tab_prefs. The Runner persists the committed copy via Settings.save.

  #      Miner        below the seam — reachable with `0`, not with a digit
  #
  # ONE ORDERED LIST, AND THE POSITION IS THE STATE. Order and visibility used to be two
  # separate things you edited with two separate keys — `⇧K`/`⇧J` moved a row inside a list
  # where an off-bar tab could sit BETWEEN two slots, and `space` flipped a `✓` that had
  # nothing to do with where the row was. So "slot 3" and "third row" were different facts, and
  # the card could not be read as the bar it was editing.
  #
  # Now the list is PARTITIONED (`Chrome.bar_partition`): the bar first, in bar order, then
  # everything `0` reaches, with a seam drawn between them. The visibility bit belongs to the
  # POSITION, not to the tab — `⇧K`/`⇧J` swap the two rows' tabs and leave the bits where they
  # are, so moving a row up across the seam puts it on the bar and pushes its neighbour off.
  # One gesture, one meaning: rearranging IS choosing.
  #
  # `space` is the same move written short — it sends a row straight across the seam, which is
  # the one gesture that changes HOW MANY are on the bar rather than which. The bar is NINE
  # numbered slots (`Chrome::MAX_SLOTS`), so a tenth is refused (⇧K trades instead), as is
  # taking the last one off.
  #
  # A row is on the bar exactly when it sits above the seam; it wears its slot number there.
  # The only other mark is the `✓` for a tab riding an UNCAPPED bar past the ninth slot, where
  # being on the bar is true and there is no digit left to print.
