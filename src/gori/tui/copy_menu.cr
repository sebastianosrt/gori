module Gori::Tui
  # Pure helpers that turn an HTTP message into the "copy as X" option set the
  # CopyPicker overlay shows — split a request into url/headers/body/cookies/curl
  # (plus wscat for WebSocket Repeater), a response into status+headers/body/raw. No
  # TUI/state deps (Screen/Theme), so
  # the parsing is unit-testable on its own; the Runner wraps the result in a
  # CopyPicker and the controllers feed it the focused pane's bytes.
  #
  # The request PARSING and the curl serializer itself live in surface-neutral
  # `Gori::Export::Curl` — `gori run show --format curl` emits the same command, and the one
  # way for a CLI to do that without importing `Tui::` (which the layering contract forbids
  # for core, and which nothing else in `cli/` does) is for the bytes-to-shell-command rule
  # to have a home outside this file. What stays here is the MENU: which rows to offer, in
  # what order, under which mnemonic.
  module CopyMenu
    # One offered copy format: the row `label`, its mnemonic `key` (unique within a
    # single option list — the picker dispatches on it), and the `text` placed on
    # the clipboard when chosen.
