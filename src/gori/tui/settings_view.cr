module Gori::Tui
  # The interactive form editor for gori's persisted config (Gori::Settings).
  # Reusable by both the Runner (a :settings overlay) and the ProjectPicker (a
  # settings mode); dedicated list/swatch editors handle themes, tabs, hostnames,
  # env and hotkeys.

  # Apply semantics: the upstream proxy takes effect immediately (Upstream.dial
  # reads it live). The bind address is persisted here; in-project the Runner
  # rebinds the running proxy to it immediately, and the picker (no live proxy)
  # has it take effect on the next project open. The theme is applied by the Runner
  # on save (Theme.apply + a full repaint).

    # `choices` cycles among those values (←/→/space); an `opener` field is an action row
    # whose ↵ opens the named sub-overlay (e.g. :hosts) and whose value column is
    # display-only; the rest are free-text lines.
    # `readonly` is a DISPLAY row: it shows a live summary of something configured elsewhere and
    # swallows every edit. It exists so a table that lives only in settings.json is still
    # discoverable from the UI, without pretending to be editable here.
    #
    # `choices` are the STORED codes, in cycle order, and `@values` holds one of them verbatim.
    # `choice_labels` is what the row draws for a code (absent = the code itself) and is read
    # in exactly one place, `render_field_value`. Nothing parses a label back: the four
    # `*_from_label` helpers this replaced turned a displayed string into a setting, so the
