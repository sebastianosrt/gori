  # Help's two reference pages — the keyboard cheat-sheet and the QL reference — as a popup
  # over whatever you were already doing, opened from the command palette (or, for the Query
  # page, by `?` on an empty filter bar).
  #
  # It exists because the answer lived a tab switch away. Wondering "what key sends this?"
  # mid-Repeater meant leaving the Repeater: the pane, the selection and the place you were
  # in all go, and coming back means finding them again. The palette already floats over the
  # body without disturbing it, so routing Help through it costs nothing to open and nothing
  # to close — esc puts the operator back on the exact pane they asked from.
  #
  # The rows are HelpView's OWN rows (`HelpView.shortcut_rows` / `.query_rows`), painted with
  # HelpView's own `draw_row`. Nothing about the content lives here. That is deliberate and it
  # is the same rule the Query page itself was written under (help_view.cr's note on
  # FILTER_HINT/QUERY_HINT): a second hand-authored copy of a reference drifts from the first,
  # and the drift is invisible from either side.
  #
  # Read-only, so there is no `on_commit` and `handle_key` never answers :commit.

    # that truncates the sentence explaining the key is worse than no popup.

    # `draw_row` gives a description `box.w - 27` columns (2 pad + KEY_W + KEY_GAP on the left,

    # Repeater's `^V`) plus that overhead, rounded up. A spec pins it against the real table so
    # a longer row added later fails there rather than silently truncating here.
