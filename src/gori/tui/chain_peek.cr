  # A caret-anchored tooltip that reveals the CONCEALED `¦chain` of the §…§ marker under
  # the cursor — the read-time counterpart to inline concealment (only `§value§` is drawn
  # in the editor; the transform chain rides here). Modelled on EnvPeek: anchored at the
  # caret cell, flipping above/below by available room. Adds a `^Q edit` affordance so the
  # (otherwise hidden) edit path stays discoverable. The owning TextArea decides whether
  # the caret sits in a chained marker and feeds the chain via `set`; this holds only open
  # state + drawing.
