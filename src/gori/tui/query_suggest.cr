  # The completion row under a filter bar: what Tab would take, what it MEANS, and what else is
  # on offer — plus the standing hints that stand in when there is nothing to complete.
  #
  # It exists because the row used to be one muted string per surface (`"↹ #{sugg.first(8)…}"`,
  # copied five times) and the hints beside it were hand-written prose (copied three times, and
  # disagreeing: History's listed `AND OR NOT` and not `-`, Intercept's listed both, Sitemap's and
  # Issues' listed neither). A filter bar is where this language is LEARNED — it is the only place
  # most operators ever see the grammar — so the row that teaches it should not be the part of the
  # codebase most likely to be stale.
  #
  # Two things the flat row could never say, and this one does:
  #
  #   * WHICH candidate Tab takes. Every surface splices `sugg.first` and every surface painted
  #     all eight identically, so the row showed the outcome of pressing Tab nowhere in it.
  #   * WHAT the candidate means. `resp.body:` is not self-describing, and a field pool can only
  #     ever list names — the meanings live in `QL::FIELD_HELP`, beside the parser that implements
  #     them, and are read from there rather than restated here.

    # The default help source, hoisted out of the parameter lists below: a default argument that

    # The boolean operators, offered as completion candidates. A field pool can only ever list
    # field names, so `NOT` and `OR` had no completion at all: typing `N` matched nothing and the
    # row went blank under the "deliberately free-texting a word" policy. They lived only in the
    # standing hint, which disappears the moment you type — so the grammar's two most useful
    # spellings were reachable only by already knowing them.
    #
    # `NOT (` matters most and is the reason this exists: `-` negates a TERM and cannot negate a
    # GROUP, so `NOT ( … )` is the only way to exclude a disjunction and it was the one form with
    # zero discovery. The trailing `(` is part of the candidate because the shape is the lesson.
    #
    # Matched CASE-SENSITIVELY, which is not a detail: `FilterAst` recognises these uppercase and
    # unquoted only, precisely so searching for the words "and"/"or"/"not" still works. Offering
    # `NOT (` for a typed `n` would advertise an operator that would compile as free text. No QL
    # field begins with n/o/a either, so an uppercase prefix collides with nothing.

    # `candidates` plus any operator the typed token could still become. Appended AFTER the field
    # candidates so a field never loses its slot; in practice the two sets never overlap.
    #
    # Takes the whole `Cursor`, not just `core`, because completion SPLICES OVER the token's full
    # span — punctuation included. A bare `"OR"` spliced over `(O` deletes the opening paren and
    # silently dissolves the group the operator was being typed to build, so an operator candidate
    # has to carry `cur.prefix` exactly as a field candidate does.
    #
    # And a `-` in that prefix disqualifies operators outright rather than carrying: `-NOT (`
    # lexes as one WORD (`word_tok` tests the whole chunk, which is not `NOT`), so offering it
    # would complete a token the grammar reads as free text — the very thing the case-sensitive

    # the exact keystroke where the operator committed to an exclusion. `FilterAst.token_at`
