          gori run project — list/create/delete projects, or manage project-scoped config

          Usage: gori run project [<subcommand>] [options]

          Subcommands:
            list               List projects holding captured traffic (default when no subcommand)
            create <name>      Create (or reopen) a project by name
            delete|rm <name>   Delete a project and everything captured in it
            scope              Manage scope rules (list, add, update, delete, enable/disable)
            sandbox            Get/set the hard-containment sandbox gate (status, on, off)
            env                Manage project env vars ($KEY substitution)
            host-override      Manage host overrides (list, add, update, delete)

          Examples:
            gori run project --format json
            gori run project list --all
            gori run project create "API test" --description="staging sweep"
            gori run project delete api-test --yes
            gori run project scope add --kind=include --type=host --pattern=api.example.com
            gori run project sandbox on
            gori run project env set TOKEN=secret
            gori run project host-override add --host=api.example.com --ip=10.0.0.1
