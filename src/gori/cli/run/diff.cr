# `gori run diff` — the retest report: diff two projects at ENDPOINT scale (the
# project-level counterpart of `gori run compare`, which diffs two flows).
#
# Reads only. Two grouped queries, one shared fold tree, no bodies and no network — see
# `Gori::Diff`, which owns the comparison and all three renderings so this command, the
# MCP `diff_projects` tool and the TUI cannot describe one comparison three ways.
