      # Ctrl-C during a long sweep, for every `gori run` subcommand that drives an engine.
      #
      # A raw SIGINT used to just kill the process, and for the three buffering subcommands
      # that meant total data loss: `gori run fuzz --format json` and `gori run mine --format
      # json` accumulate every row and print ONCE after the drain, so forty minutes of results
      # went to the garbage collector. `gori run discover` had this fixed (its `pending` rows
      # never reached the DB); fuzz, mine and sequence never got it. Same defect, three
      # surfaces — so it lives here now rather than being copied a fourth time.
      #
      # The trap body does the minimal safe thing only: a send into a buffered channel, the
      # same shape `Gori::App#install_signal_traps` uses. The actual stop runs on a fiber.
      # `stop` is expected to make the engine drain in-flight work and close its event channel
      # exactly like a normal finish, so the caller's `engine.run` returns on its own and
      # whatever flush/emit the normal path already does covers the interrupted path too —
      # no separate write from inside the trap or the watcher.
      #
      # A SECOND signal EXITS. Without that escalation the first Ctrl-C consumed the token, the
      # watcher fiber was gone, and `Signal::INT.trap` had permanently replaced the default
      # disposition — so every later Ctrl-C did nothing at all and the operator's only way out
      # of a slow stop (a `stop` bounded by in-flight retries against a dead origin) was SIGKILL
      # from another terminal. 130 is the conventional "terminated by SIGINT" status.
      #
      # Returns a proc reading the `interrupted` flag, so the caller can report the run as cut
      # short without threading a second value through its own signature.

        # trap (capacity-1 channel, `send` waits rather than raising) and INT/TERM
