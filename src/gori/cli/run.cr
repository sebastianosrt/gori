      # ── session bindings, headless ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
      #
      # A session binding lives in the MEMORY of the gori that observed it and is never
      # persisted (`Bindings`: a restored token is stale by construction, and re-extracting
      # costs one request). Only `Repeater::Sender` and the proxy write the table — a sweep
      # deliberately does not, because a response echoing an attack payload back could
      # otherwise rebind the operator's session to it.
      #
      # In the TUI and over MCP that is fine: one process holds a send and the sweep that
      # follows. `gori run` is ONE-SHOT per process and had no command that sends first, so a
      # `$SESSION` in a headless fuzz/mine/sequence template could never acquire a value and
      # every request was refused — 100% of them, against every authenticated target. The
      # refusal said "nothing has extracted it yet", which reads as "wait, or retry".
      #
      # `--bind-from FLOW-ID` is the missing step, and it is deliberately a REPLAY rather than
      # persistence: it puts the deliberate send and the sweep inside one process, which is
      # exactly the shape that already works everywhere else. Persisting the value instead
      # would ship a token minutes-to-days stale into the run and produce the page of 401s the
      # feature exists to remove.

      # The {scheme, host, target} `guard_outbound` judges a `--bind-from` seed by. Named rather
      # than inlined so the decision is spec-able without a live send, the way
      # `repeater_out_of_scope?` is for `gori run repeater`. The target comes from
      # `Outbound.request_target` — the one home for reading a request-target off raw bytes,
      # which recovers it from an irregular request line instead of gating an empty path.
      private def self.bind_from_scope_parts(built : Repeater::FlowRequest::Built) : {String, String, String, Int32}

      # WHY a `--bind-from` seed replay may not go out, or nil to proceed — Layer 2, judged on
      # the SWEEP's terms rather than the Repeater's.
      #
      # The replay travels through `Repeater::Sender`, whose per-send gate is
      # `Outbound#send_block`: Sandbox ALONE, because an EXCLUDE rule deliberately does not stop
      # ONE hand-authored Repeater send — a human replaying a single request has already decided.
      # A `--bind-from` seed is not that request. It is the first send of an automated sweep,
      # issued by the sweep's own invocation, so it takes the sweep's gate — `sweep_block`, which
      # is exactly what `EXCLUDE_SWEEP_ERROR` promises when it says "excludes hold even under
      # --allow-unscoped". Without this, `--allow-unscoped` waived Layer 1 and `send_block`
      # skipped the exclude, so `discover --bind-from N --allow-unscoped` (and `fuzz`/`mine`/
      # `sequence`, which share this helper) replayed the FULL captured request — cookies and
      # Authorization included — to a host the operator had explicitly carved out.
      #
      # Named rather than inlined for the same reason `bind_from_scope_parts` is: the decision
      # is spec-able without a live send.
      #
      # `port` is the seed's OWN dial port, not the sweep's — `bind_from_scope_parts` reads it
      # off the capture's target for the same reason the host comes from there. It reaches the
      # EXCLUDE side, so a carve-out that names a port stops the seed replay too (#884).
