    # Unlike its siblings this pane has no a/e/d: the feed is append-only and read here, so the
    # verbs are all lenses over it plus one jump. They go through the keymap rather than being
    # hard-coded in the key handler for the usual three reasons — the space menu lists them, the
    # Hotkeys editor can rebind them, and the advertised set is the acting set.

      # `⇧X`, and NOT anything built on `c`. `c` is `capture.toggle` in Global scope
      # (`verbs/core.cr`) — the key an operator hits by reflex to stop capture, and the one the
      # other five Project panes still pass through. A scoped chord wins over the Global
      # fallback, so binding `c` here would replace "stop capture" with "destroy the durable
      # audit trail" on exactly one pane; the confirm defaults to cancel, but a reflex that
      # silently stops working is its own defect. ⇧C avoided that collision, but it left the
      # project wipe one shift away from the most-pressed triage key in the app, which is the
      # arrangement to avoid rather than the one to settle for.
      #
      # ⇧X is what every other "wipe this tab" verb answers — `history.clear`, `probe.clear`,
      # `authorize.clear`, `issues.clear` — and `X` is the space-menu key in all of them. Bare `x`
      # is bound in none of those scopes, so the shifted key has no same-pane neighbour at all;
      # here it cost `activity.clear-filters` its 'x' menu letter, which moved to 'N' above.
