    # `Verb::Scope::Editor` — the keys a TEXT EDITOR pane owns, wherever it is.
    #
    # These nine verbs used to be nine controllers' worth of hand-rolled arms
    # (`when c == 'i' then view.enter_request_insert!` × 11 panes — KEY_AUDIT §1.4/§2e).
    # They were hand-rolled because `Keymap#lookup` is keyed by `Scope` alone: the Repeater
    # binds one scope across a request EDITOR and a read-only RESPONSE, so "↵ enters INSERT
    # here, ↵ sends there" was not a thing two chords could say. `Scope::Editor` is that
    # missing focus dimension — `Runner#scope_chain` puts it AHEAD of the tab's own scope
    # while an editor pane holds focus, and drops it the moment focus leaves. So `↵` resolves
    # to `editor.insert` in the request pane and falls through to `repeater.send` in the
    # response pane, with no controller arm in either.
    #
    # Being a real scope is what makes them REBINDABLE and what lets a KEYSET
    # (`Verb::Keyset`) respell them as a bundle: a vim-shaped operator moves `x`→`V`,
    # `^Z`→`u`, `^F`→`/` by picking a keyset, not by rebinding eleven panes one at a time.
    #
    # What is deliberately NOT here:
    #   • COPY and SELECT LINE. Both are already per-tab verbs (`repeater.copy`,
    #     `notes.select-line`, … in read_edit.cr) whose bare `y`/`x` were only ever DEAD
    #     because a controller arm shadowed them. Deleting the arms makes the existing verbs
    #     live; moving them into Editor as well would put two verbs on one letter with the
    #     Editor one always winning, which is the shadowing this file exists to end.
    #   • Edits beyond delete and paste. `d` / `p` and vim's `dd` / `yy` are here (see below,
    #     and `Tui::ReadEdit`); open-line, join, change and the rest of an operator grammar are
    #     not. A keyset names keys for operations that exist; it does not grow new ones.
