      # NEXT was tried and is worse on three counts, each of which bites a different surface:
      #   • vim spells `n`/`N` as OPPOSITES, and `Keybind.from_event` normalises a typed
      #     capital to shift + lowercase — so `n` + `⇧N` on one verb makes `N` step FORWARD.
      #     The alias would invert the very reflex it was kept for.
      #   • a second chord flips `Hotkeys.rebindable?` to false, and that predicate does not
      #     just hide the editor row: `build_keymap` and `HotkeysOverlay#load_overrides` both
      #     filter persisted overrides through it, and `Hotkeys.apply` then rewrites
      #     settings from the working copy — so an alias on a NON-hidden verb (the Comparer's)
      #     drops a user's existing rebind out of dispatch and erases it on the next save.
      #   • `n` one scope up is `issues.new` (verbs/issues.cr), which CREATES a blank issue —
      #     one `esc` away from a key that meant "next" a frame earlier.
      # A key that is bound nowhere at least says so: `Runner.unbound_key_hint` answers a
      # bare printable with "nothing bound here · space menu · ? help".
      #
      # There is no bare `p` either: it is `detail.toggle-pretty` in this scope.
      #
      # NOT ⇧J/⇧K, which is claimed a level below: the detail body's
      # `handle_detail_body_select` takes every ⇧ + h/j/k/l for its text selection, and a
      # controller claim runs BEFORE this keymap, so those two would be dead in the body and
      # live on the chip strip — the position-dependent trap the ← fix exists to remove.
      #
      # Spelled `Chord.new("n", shift: true)`, never `Chord.new("N")`: `Keybind.from_event`
      # normalises a capital to shift + lowercase, so the latter never fires. Same for ⇧P.
