      # ONE verb per surface rather than one per format. The pair this replaced
      # ("issues.export-md" / "issues.export-json", plus a Markdown-only key) put the format in
      # the verb NAME, so every format added a palette entry and the tab key could only ever
      # reach one of them. The format is a per-export choice — the same finding goes to a
      # teammate as Markdown and to CI as SARIF — so it belongs in a prompt, not the registry.
      # Dropping the old ids is safe for user keybindings: `Hotkeys.rebindable_overrides`
      # filters overrides through `registry[id]?`, so one naming a removed verb is discarded
      # rather than raising.

      # ⇧E, not 'x', and it MATCHES notes.export's mnemonic on purpose. 'x' means "Select
      # line" everywhere else in the app — all nine read-mode scopes in read_edit.cr, the
      # Issues DETAIL one ↵ away included. So the list's 'x' was the odd one out, and it
      # collided with its own tab's detail view. Sharing 'E' with Notes makes export one key
      # across tabs and leaves x = Select line exception-free.
      #
      # The chord is Chord.new("e", shift: true), NOT Chord.new("E"): Keybind.from_event
      # normalises a typed capital to shift + lowercase, so an "E" chord would never fire.
      # menu_key skips shift chords, hence the intent's lexicon letter — the same pairing
      # notes.send-to uses for 'S'.
