      # readable straight off the registry — a selection-delete like `issues.delete` above is
      # `:danger` and may ride a bare letter; a store-emptier may not.

      # This tab was left out of that rollout, which is the whole reason the chord is here.

      # destructive, so neither is a slip away from one that is.

      # NOT mark-aware, deliberately: `d` is the verb that acts on a marked set, and a wipe
      # that quietly meant "the marks" on some presses and "everything" on others would be a
