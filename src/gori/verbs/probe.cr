      #
      # This is NOT the bare `x` coming back. 0edc3c5b took the wipe off an UNMODIFIED letter,
      # and both halves of its objection were about that: one chip to the right, on the Rules
      # sub-tab, `x` is a harmless enable toggle, and no Probe hint ever named the destructive
      # reading — so of the two meanings the unadvertised one was the dangerous one. A shifted
      # chord answers both. It shares no key with that toggle, which has since moved out of
      # reach structurally as well (the Rules sub-tab reports `Verb::Scope::ProbeRules` from
      # `ProbeController#command_scope`, so its `x` and this scope's ⇧X can never resolve on
      # the same keystroke), and it is advertised in the two places the bare key never was:
      # the Help sheet's Probe row and this list's body hint. The space-menu entry therefore
      # stays exactly where 0edc3c5b put it, the palette still reaches the verb, and the
      # confirm still gates it — the chord is added to that shape, not traded against it.
      #
      # ⇧X and not ⇧C: bare `x` is bound in none of the clear-all scopes, while bare `c`
      # is live in all of them — here it is `probe.dismiss-selected`, the most-pressed key on
      # this list. A project wipe does not belong one shift above it.
      #
      # `Chord.new("x", shift: true)`, NOT `Chord.new("X")`: `Keybind.from_event` normalises a
      # typed capital to shift+lowercase, so the capital spelling never fires. `menu_key` skips
