    # "Send flow to…" (`>`) holds the cross-tool sends of the selected flow(s). Send to
    # Repeater is `pinned:` on every tab that has it, so it keeps its level-1 letter (`r`, or
    # `R` where `r` runs the tab) and `space > r` also reaches it everywhere. Active scan and
    # Mock stay direct rows: one scans and one creates a rule, neither hands the flow on.
    # A bare `>` opens the card from the tab too (`chord:`, #1295): no scope and no Global
    # binds `>`, and a hand that drops the `space` before `> f` still lands in the card.

    # "Display…" (`Z`) holds the toggles that change how a pane DRAWS what it holds — never a
    # write-back like pretty-print-request, which changes the request itself. Sticky: after a
    # flip the card comes back at the same row, whose `●`/`○` says what the pane now shows.
    # `a` shows every row a default lens leaves out — Probe's closed issues, the Params tab's
    # standard headers — the letter both tabs already answer bare (#1295).
    # Not `V`: under the vim keyset ⇧V selects a line in every read pane this row is drawn in,
    # so a dropped space would select instead of opening the card. `z` is vim's view-and-fold
    # prefix, and the capital keeps the lower case for single rows.
    # One intent reads one letter everywhere, so hex is `x` in the History detail and in both
    # Repeater panes (it was `e`, `x` and `h`). The Fuzzer's sort is a direct row: it is the
    # key a results triage presses most.
    # A bare `⇧Z` opens the card as `>` opens Send flow to… (`chord:`): without it a dropped
    # `space` made `Z` a no-op and read the member letter bare, so `Z c` stopped capture and
    # `Z x` selected a line. No scope and no Global binds `⇧Z`.

    # TLS fingerprint row shows its preset's name rather than `●`. A bare `⇧P` opens it, for
    # Display…'s reason: `P c` stopped capture and `P 2` jumped to the second tab. `⇧P` is
