      # `verb/reserved.cr`, so a chord could only be taken FROM something. A reference page is
      # not what you spend that on, and the palette is where an operator already goes to ask
      # "what can I do here".
      #
      # The ids carry the search terms the titles cannot. The palette fuzzy-scores
      # "#{title} #{id}", so `help.hotkeys` is what makes a query of "hotkey" land while the
      # title says "Keyboard shortcuts" — the two words an operator might reach for are
      # covered between them.
