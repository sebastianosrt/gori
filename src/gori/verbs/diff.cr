    # The Diff sub-tab's verbs (the retest report under Target). Gated by SCOPE alone, like
    # the Sitemap's — `Verb::Scope::Diff` is only consulted while that sub-tab is active, so
    # a second `available:` predicate would say the same thing twice.
    #
    # The four slot/run verbs carry NO `group:`. `SpaceMenu#split_semantic` bands a scope by
    # `GROUP_ORDER` and sweeps the leftovers with `group == :none`, so any symbol outside that
    # list — `:common`, which is a `section:` value — matches neither band and the verb
    # vanishes from the menu. Untagged is the deliberate answer here: "pick a side, swap, run"
    # is this tab's own vocabulary, not one of the six cross-tab bands.
