    # The Rewriter tab's space-menu / palette actions. The body is a navigable list (not a
    # text editor), so these also bind as direct body keys in the controller; the mnemonics
    # here drive the space menu + palette.
    #
    # ALL of them are `section: :rules`, not :common, and `RewriterController#command_section`
    # answers `:rules` / `:preview` to match. Two reasons, one structural and one a defect:
    # the PREVIEW OUTPUT pane grew its own read verbs whose `x` means "select line" — the same
    # letter this list spends on "Enable/disable", which `Registry#validate_menu_keys!` refuses
    # inside one displayable view — and, before that, the menu offered every rule action while
    # the preview pane held focus, acting on a row the operator was not looking at. That is the
    # leak `Runner#rewriter_rule_selected?` documents, one axis over: it remembered `@sub` and
    # forgot `@focus`.

      # real chords, and the preview panes share this body — `d` with the preview focused
      # would delete the rule sitting behind it. The space menu was already safe by another
      # route (`command_section` answers :preview there, and every verb here is
      # `section: :rules`), but a chord has no section to hide behind.

      # the Sitemap and the Intercept queue), `x` is "select this line" in fourteen scopes, and
      # a rule list has no marks. The `available:` gate is the focus disambiguator the arm used
