module Gori
  # Payload values read from data the project ALREADY captured (#1352): a QL query picks a set
  # of flows, a projection turns that set into a deterministic, de-duplicated list of strings,
  # and a Fuzzer set or a Miner name list consumes it like any other. `--payload-from 'host:api
  # param-names'` is the engagement's own vocabulary as a wordlist, with no temp file to write.
  #
  # ## Where this runs, and what it never does
  #
  # It is a READ over the store, resolved by the plan builders (`Fuzz::Plan.build`,
  # `Miner::Plan.build`) — never on the proxy path and never on the Store writer, so a large
  # project costs the operator's own `run` a few hundred milliseconds and costs capture
  # nothing (P6). The walk is the one the parameter inventory and the OpenAPI export share
  # (`ParamInventory.each_flow`): newest first, id-cursor paged, one flow's bytes in hand at a
  # time, the scheduler handed back after every flow. Nothing here sends a request.
  #
  # ## Bounded, deterministic, de-duplicated
  #
  # Every read is capped — flows read, distinct values kept, total value bytes, one value's
  # length — and the cap that ended a resolution is REPORTED, never silent. The order is the
  # walk's: newest flow first, and within a flow the order `Params.each` reads, first sighting
  # wins. The same project state and options give the same list, so a saved command line
  # reproduces its run.
  #
  # ## Values are kept as captured (P7)
  #
  # A projected value is the captured value, byte for byte: it is not trimmed, not decoded past
  # what `Params` already does (a query value is percent-decoded there, so the Fuzzer's position
  # rule can encode it once, not twice), and not filtered for line breaks. A value holding CR,
  # LF or NUL is COUNTED in the report and kept, because dropping it would decide for the
  # operator which of their captured bytes are payloads. What a position does with it is the
  # position's rule: a query or form position percent-encodes it (`Fuzz::AutoEncode`), a path
  # position takes it raw.
  #
  # ## Secrets
  #
  # A captured request carries cookies, authorization headers and credential-named fields, and
  # a value read out of the project is one `send` away from another host. So the DEFAULT
  # excludes every location that is credential material by construction (cookies, headers) and
  # every value the project's redaction policy would mask (`ParamInventory::Sensitivity`: a
  # credential-named field, a JWT or key shape). `include_sensitive` is the explicit opt-in, it
  # is REPORTED on the resolution, and `extracted` — whose whole point is a value an extract
  # rule pulled out of a response, session tokens and CSRF nonces included — refuses to run
  # without it. NAMES are not values: a cookie or credential-named field's NAME is a fine
  # candidate parameter name, so `param-names` does not withhold them.
  #
  # The memory-only binding table (#501) is never read: `extracted` re-applies the stored extract
  # RULES to stored responses, the same way a History display column does, so nothing live is
  # written anywhere and nothing durable is made of a live secret.
