    # be too or the pair disagrees about which capture it describes. Two `--db` databases in
    # one directory each hold their OWN lock — deliberately, they are separate databases with
    # separate capture sessions — and both used to write this ONE directory-keyed file: the
    # second one's bind address overwrote the first's, and the first to close DELETED the
    # marker of a session still capturing. The picker then showed a live project on the wrong
