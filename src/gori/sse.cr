  # Parses a Server-Sent Events (`text/event-stream`) body into discrete events.
  # This is a DISPLAY-time projection over an already content-decoded body — the
  # counterpart of `Proxy::H2::Grpc.messages` for gRPC. gori captures an SSE
  # response as one opaque body blob (it streams through the generic body path);
  # this splits it back into the events the server emitted so the detail view can
  # show them individually instead of as a wall of `event:`/`data:` lines.
  #
  # Follows the WHATWG event-stream parsing rules: UTF-8; CR, LF, or CRLF line
  # terminators; `event:` / `data:` / `id:` / `retry:` fields; one optional space
  # after the colon is stripped; lines starting with `:` are comments. An event is
  # dispatched at each blank line; a block with no `data` field is not emitted.

    # Safety ceiling on events parsed from one body, so a pathological stream of
    # millions of tiny events can't blow up memory (the detail view caps display
    # separately). Far above any realistic captured stream.

    # reconnection time (ms) if the block carried one.
