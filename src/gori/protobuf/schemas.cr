module Gori::Protobuf
  # WHERE the open project's `.proto` schema comes from, and what a captured gRPC path
  # resolves to through it. `Schema` parses a descriptor set; this decides which ones are
  # loaded and answers "what message is `/demo.Users/GetUser`'s request?".
  #
  # ## A per-project global, like `Settings.project_env_vars`
  #
  # The four surfaces that render a gRPC body — the History framing pane, the Repeater
  # transcript, `gori run show --format json`, MCP `get_flow` — reach the payload through
  # class methods and static serializers with no Store in hand. Threading a store into each
  # would mean four independently-drifting answers to "is there a schema?", which is the
  # shape #496 already cost this code once. So the loaded schema is published HERE, by
  # `load_project`, from the same handful of sites that publish the project's env vars and
  # network overrides — see the call sites in `Session.open`, `CLI::Run.open_store` and MCP's
  # bind/switch.
  #
  # ## Loading a file is not an outbound action; reflection is
  #
  # P4 constrains gori from touching the network unasked; reading a descriptor set the
  # operator dropped in their own directory is neither a request nor a disclosure. Server
  # REFLECTION (#827) IS an outbound request, and nothing in THIS module makes one: the
  # network belongs to `Protobuf::Reflection`, which runs only when an operator asks. What
  # arrives here is the CACHED result (`Store#grpc_reflections`) — bytes already on disk,
  # read exactly as a file source is read.
  #
  # ## Both sources merge, with reflection last
  #
  # Files load first, then each cached reflection target in fetch order. Last-wins on a
  # fully-qualified name, so a target reflected after a file was loaded supersedes it — which
  # is the direction the operator's most recent deliberate act points. Nothing is hidden by
  # it: `Schema#conflicts` counts every differing redefinition and `status` prints the count.
