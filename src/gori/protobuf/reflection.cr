module Gori::Protobuf
  # gRPC **server reflection** as a schema source (#827): ask the target what it serves,
  # and hand the descriptors it returns to the same `Schema` a `protoc --descriptor_set_out`
  # file feeds (#823). The operator no longer has to produce a descriptor set by hand.
  #
  # ## What it is NOT allowed to be
  #
  # An outbound request gori makes on its own. Two rules hold this file:
  #
  #   * **P4 — the human decides.** Nothing here runs on capture, on opening a flow, or on
  #     project open. `fetch` is called from a verb, a `gori run grpc reflect` invocation, or
  #     an MCP `grpc_reflect` call, and from nowhere else. The CACHE is what a later flow
  #     reads; the network is touched only when someone asked.
  #   * **The outbound scope chokepoint.** `Outbound` is a required constructor argument
  #     (`Client.new`), exactly as it is on `Fuzz::Sender` / `Repeater::Sender`, and BOTH its
  #     layers run before the dialer is reached — Layer 1 (`check_request`, the surface's
  #     allowlist policy) and Layer 2 (`send_block`, Sandbox). A refused target produces a
  #     `refused?` Outcome and no socket.
  #
  # And P7 is unchanged by any of it: what comes back is a lens over captured bytes. An
  # undeclared field number still renders raw, and a wire/schema disagreement is still shown
  # as a disagreement — `Lens` decides that, and reflection changes nothing about how.
  #
  # ## Why not `Repeater::Sender`
  #
  # That class is documented as "the dial seam for a single HAND-AUTHORED send", and two of
  # the things it does at that seam are wrong for a request gori composed itself: it expands
  # `$NAME` bindings and overlays the active session slot into bytes no operator wrote, and
  # it offers the response to the binding table's extract rules (`Sender#extract`) — which
  # would let a descriptor blob rebind the operator's `$SESSION`. The GATE is the part that
  # must be shared, and it is: the same `Outbound`, the same two layers, asked about the
  # `:path` this fetch will actually route on. `Sender` derives that path from a synthesized
  # request line (`H2Engine.field_scope_line`) because its caller hands it opaque fields;
  # here gori WROTE the path, so it is passed straight in.
  #
  # ## The call shape
  #
  # `ServerReflectionInfo` is bidirectional streaming. gori writes every request of a round
  # into one stream, half-closes, and reads the replies in order — the request-then-close
  # shape every reflection client uses, and the only one `H2Engine`'s one-shot exchange can
  # express. Discovery therefore costs one stream per ROUND, not per symbol:
  #
  #   round 1  list_services
  #   round 2  file_containing_symbol × every service listed
  #   round 3+ file_by_filename × every `dependency` not yet held, until the import graph
  #            closes or `MAX_ROUNDS` stops it
