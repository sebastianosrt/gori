# Project ACTIVITY pane (#864) — verbs, reopens Gori::Verb::ExecContext (see verb/context.cr
# for the full facade and the class-reopening convention this mirrors store/compact.cr).
abstract class Gori::Verb::ExecContext
  # The #124 event feed, read by a human. Every verb here is a LENS over an append-only log —
  # there is nothing to add or edit, which is why this block has no a/e/d and why `↵` opens the
  # thing an event NAMES rather than the event itself.
  #
  # With ONE deliberate exception: `activity_clear` empties the feed. It is the only destructive
  # verb in this scope, it is irreversible, and it takes the audit trail with it — so it asks
  # first, it is off the app-wide `c` (capture toggle) on a shifted chord, and it is called out
  # here rather than left for an implementer to discover behind a "read-only" label.
