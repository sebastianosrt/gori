    # Same-scope keybinding conflict detection for the hotkey editor. A chord clashes
    # ONLY when another verb claims it in the SAME scope — that's the genuine ambiguity
    # (the keymap's `by_scope[scope][chord]` would silently keep just one). Cross-scope
    # reuse is deliberate and must be allowed: the lookup resolves the active scope BEFORE
    # the Global fallback, so a scoped chord intentionally SHADOWS a same-key Global one
    # (e.g. `s` = swap on Comparer / scope-lens elsewhere; `c` = catch-direction on
    # Intercept / capture-toggle elsewhere). Blocking those would forbid bindings gori
    # itself already ships.
