    # The space menu's intent lexicon (#1274): one menu letter per RECURRING intent, looked up
    # here instead of spelled per verb. A verb that declares `intent:` gets its letter from this
    # table (`Definition#menu_key`), and `Registry#validate_intents!` refuses one that also
    # spells a `mnemonic:`, so two tabs cannot drift apart on "filter" or "export" by review
    # oversight: neither of them names the letter.
    #
    # It is the menu half of the 2026-09-12 bare-key table (DESIGN.md §7): the rows marked R2
    # below are that table's letters carried into the menu. An intent that exists on one tab
    # only is not an entry; its letter stays a per-scope `mnemonic:` or chord.
    #
    # Two tiers:
    #   • :reserved  — in a scope that has the intent, no other verb spends the letter, in any
    #     section (`spec/verb/lexicon_spec.cr`). The R2 letters, the copy/send pickers, the mark
    #     trio, ⇧X, and the sub-tab strip's own actions.
    #   • :preferred — the letter is this intent's wherever the intent exists, and free for a
    #     local meaning where it does not. Reserving every entry app-wide would leave a dozen
    #     letters for the per-scope rows.
