    # EDITOR KEYSETS — a named bundle of key overrides for the small, fixed set of verbs a
    # text-editor pane owns. Exactly the mechanism `OsProfile::OVERRIDES` is, one layer up:
    # a table of verb-id → replacement chords, applied in `Keymap.effective_chords`.
    #
    # It is a MAPPING, not an emulation. gori's editors are modal (READ ↔ INS) and their
    # READ grammar is helix-shaped — `x` selects the line, then `y` copies or `d` deletes the
    # selection, and `p` pastes — which is a real, coherent grammar that a vim-trained hand
    # fights on exactly those gestures. A keyset moves the keys. It does not add counts, text
    # objects, motions after an operator, or any editing operation gori's panes do not have.
    # Naming keys for operations that do not exist is how "vim mode" becomes a promise the
    # editor breaks.
    #
    # `Chord` is ONE keystroke, so `gg` cannot be spelled at all. `dd` and `yy` are the one
    # exception, and not a chord: `editor.delete-line` / `editor.yank-line` arm on the first
    # press and the Runner takes the second (`Runner#finish_editor_op`), so the table below
    # still only names single keys. `:`-prefixed commands are out because `Verb::Reserved`
    # keeps `:` for the command line. Each limit is named in docs/content/guide/hotkeys.md
    # rather than silently approximated.
    #
    # PRECEDENCE, which is the whole contract: **user rebind > keyset > OS profile >
    # the verb's declared chords** (`Keymap.effective_chords`). A keyset is a better
    # DEFAULT, never a ceiling — picking `vim` and then moving one key leaves that key moved.

      # select-line verb this list does not carry.
      #
      # `intercept.select-line` is deliberately absent: it is KEYLESS by design (verbs/
      # read_edit.cr — the Intercept queue spends nearly every letter, so that pane reaches
      # select-line from the space menu). A keyset respells keys; it does not hand a key to a
      # pane whose author decided against one.

      # The `vim` table. Every row respells a verb that already exists:
      #   • SELECT LINE `x` → `⇧V`. The one gesture that actually trips a vim hand, and the
      #     reason this feature exists. `V` is free in all fifteen scopes (only Scope::Diff
      #     binds it, and Diff has no select-line); `validate_chords!` sweeps every keyset on
      #     every OS profile at boot, so a future clash is a startup failure, not a shadow.
      #   • COPY stays `y`. It is already vim's letter, and `yy` is a chord SEQUENCE the
      #     keymap cannot express — but `y` with no selection already copies the whole pane,
      #     which is the useful half of what `yy` would mean.
      #   • UNDO `^Z` → `u`. `^Z` keeps undoing inside INSERT either way: the nine editor
      #     ladders claim it upstream of the keymap (Hotkeys' CLAIMED_CTRL_LETTERS), which is
      #     where a typing hand wants it.
      #   • FIND `^F` → `/`. Free in an editor pane — the `/` filter bars all live on LIST
      #     scopes, which are never on the Editor chain. `^F` still opens the prompt from the
      #     Runner's guard, INSERT included.
      #   • INSERT `i` and BACK-TO-READ `esc` need no row: gori already spells them that way.
      #   • APPEND `a` and TOP/BOTTOM `g` / `⇧G` give a key to three verbs `helix` leaves
      #     unbound. Both halves of append (one column right, then INSERT) are motions the
      #     editors have; `gg` is not expressible, so `g` alone is the top.
      #   • WORD `w` / `b` and LINE INSERT `⇧A` / `⇧I`, keyless under `helix` for the same
      #     reason: the editor's ⌥←/→ word step, and Home/End then INSERT. No `$` / `0`: `$`
      #     arrives as ⇧4, the Global sub-tab jump, and `0` is Go to tab.
      #
      #   • DELETE `d` → `editor.delete-line`, YANK `y` → `editor.yank-line`: vim's `dd` and
      #     `yy` (the first press arms, the second acts), and over a `⇧V` selection the first
      #     press acts at once. gori's select-then-delete `editor.delete` gives up its `d`
      #     for that, since `editor.delete-line` deletes a selection too; `y` displaces the
      #     tab's own copy in an editor pane, which `^Y` (pinned) still reaches.
      #   • PASTE stays `p`, already vim's letter.
      #
      # No GOTO-LINE row: vim spells it `:N`, and `:` is reserved for the command line, so
      # `^G` stands in both keysets.
