# Retention itself is NOT new — Store has swept flows since long before this section existed
# (Store::RETENTION_DEFAULT, every Store::PRUNE_INTERVAL inserts). What was missing is any way
# to SEE or CHANGE the cap: it was a `Store.open` parameter with no path from settings.json or
# any UI, so an operator on a long engagement could not raise it, one on a small disk could not
# lower it, and neither could discover the number without reading the source.
