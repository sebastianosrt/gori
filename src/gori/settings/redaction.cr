# REDACTION section (settings.json "redaction"): the named profiles safe evidence export
# applies, which one is active, whether it applies without being asked, and the per-install
# secret behind every placeholder tag (#1035). See settings.cr for the load/save/serialize
# orchestration, and `Gori::Redact` for what a profile means.
#
# Global here, per-project in the project DB (`Store::REDACTION_KEY` — see
# `Redact::Policy`): a profile is engagement CONFIG, and both scopes are real. "never export a
# `password` field" belongs to the operator and follows them everywhere; "this target calls it
# `pwd_hash` and the account number lives at `/data/acct`" belongs to one engagement and must
# not follow them into the next.

  # User-defined profiles, in the order they were written. A profile whose NAME matches a
  # built-in replaces it (see `redaction_profile`) — that is how an operator edits the default
  # list, and the built-in's contents are printed by `gori run redact profiles` so there is
  # something to copy.

  # Off at the factory, and that is a deliberate choice against the issue's "explicit opt-in
  # path for raw output" read literally: flipping the default under an install that already
  # has scripts reading `gori run show --format raw` would silently change what those scripts
  # get, and a body that comes back with `[REDACTED:…]` where a signature used to be is a
  # debugging session nobody asked for. So the SETTING is the opt-in, once, per install — and
  # from then on `--no-redact` is the explicit path back to raw, exactly as asked.

  # The HMAC key behind every placeholder tag lives in `Redact.salt` and NOWHERE else — this
  # section reads it on load, writes it on save, and mints it on first use. One variable rather
  # than a persisted copy beside the engine's live one, because the two can only ever disagree
  # in the direction that matters: a stale copy here would write the wrong key to disk, and the
  # placeholders in every artifact after that would stop correlating with the ones before it.
  #
  # It is a SECRET, kept in settings.json beside `env`'s token values on the same terms (the
  # tree is 0700 and the file 0600). One consequence worth stating where the value is declared:
  # `gori settings export --sections redaction` carries it, so a profile shared that way also
  # shares the ability to re-derive every tag this install has ever written. Export the profiles
  # alone (`gori run redact profiles --format json`) to hand somebody the RULES without the key.

  # write (a read-only config, a partial load `save` refuses — see `Settings.save`), so the
  # placeholders it is about to produce are internally consistent and will NOT correlate with
  # any other session's. That is a fact worth a line on STDERR, not a reason to refuse the
