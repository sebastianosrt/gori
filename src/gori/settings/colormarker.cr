  #    own file. `Colormarker#add` refuses to CREATE one; the parser only has to not lose it.
  #
  # 2. A missing `enabled` reads as TRUE, where a rewriter rule reads FALSE. That rule exists
  #    because a rewrite rule modifies live traffic in every project, so "on" is the one
  #    direction a malformed entry may not default to. Colormarker touches no traffic: its
  #    failure-on-false is a hand-written rule that silently never appears (and an operator who
