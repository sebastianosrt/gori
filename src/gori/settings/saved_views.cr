  # A named History query that lives in settings.json and therefore appears in EVERY project.
  # The counterpart to a `saved_views` row; both fold into the runtime `SavedViews::View` list
  # through `SavedViews.merged`, exactly the way `ColormarkerRule` and `color_rules` do.
  #
  # `id` is NUMERIC, and that is load-bearing rather than aesthetic: `Settings.entry_identity`'s
  # `:id` arm reads `as_i64?`, and an entry it cannot identify makes `merge_entry_list` fall back
  # to deciding the whole list as one blob — which DELETES a view a peer created while we held
  # an older snapshot. The `oast_providers` hex-slug shape is precisely why that section is not
  # in `RULE_SECTION_LISTS`; this one is, so it pays the numeric-id price to get the entry-wise
  # merge.

  # in a different file this process may never open again, so handing a deleted view's number to
  # the next one created would silently activate a view the operator never picked.

  # `load`'s blanket rescue.

  # A view with no query narrows nothing, which is what the `All` BUILTIN already is — keeping
  # one here would put a second, unremarkable "All" in the picker under a name that promises
