  # A Match & Replace rule that lives in settings.json (`rewriter.rules`) instead of a project
  # DB, and therefore applies in EVERY project. The counterpart to a `match_rules` row; both
  # fold into the runtime `Store::MatchRule` list through `Rules.merged`, exactly the way
  # `Settings::ScanRule` and `probe_custom_rules` fold into `Probe.custom_rules`.
  #
  # This REPLACES the old preset library (`rewriter.presets`, an inert recipe you had to load
  # into a project before it did anything). The axis that library got wrong is that a rewrite
  # rule is not a recipe: "strip CSP on *.corp.internal" is a standing policy an operator wants
  # ON, everywhere, without re-loading it per project. What stays per-project is which of them
  # this engagement disagrees with — an OVERRIDE, not a copy (see `Store#rewriter_overrides`).
  #
  # The enum fields are stored as their `label` strings — the same vocabulary `gori run
  # rewriter` and the MCP rule tools already speak — so a hand-edited settings.json reads the
  # way the CLI prints.

  # id (Store#rewriter_overrides), and those rows live in a database this reset never opens
  # and cannot clear. Rewinding the counter would hand id 1 to the next rule created, and a
  # project that had disabled the OLD id 1 would silently apply that override to a rule it
  # has never seen. So the counter is the one thing here that outlives a factory reset — a
