  # message straight into a Claude Code session's turn is a research-preview surface —
  # Claude Code has to be launched with `--dangerously-load-development-channels
  # server:gori` for it to exist at all, and a push to a session that never registered the
  # channel is dropped silently. An operator who has opted into the Claude Code flag opts
  # into this too.
  #
  # It is a LAST RESORT, not an extra layer: `Courier#deliver` tries the inbox socket and the
  # `codex queue` hand-off first and returns on the one that answers, so the push happens only
  # when no route that can confirm itself is open. That ordering is what keeps the setting from
  # making delivery worse — pushing first meant a session launched WITHOUT the flag had its
  # socket taken away by a frame nobody could tell had been dropped — and it is also why there
  # is no double delivery to weigh: no message ever takes two routes. What the push does cost
  # is a second READING: it is not in `AgentDelivery::CARRIED`, so the message stays in the
  # feed for `operator_messages` and the tool-result carry, which is the safe direction.

  # in Preferences reaches an agent only when that agent's server is STARTED again — not when
  # it reconnects, and not when the client re-handshakes over the same process. The Settings
