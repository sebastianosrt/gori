# UPSTREAM RULES section (settings:network → Upstream rules): per-destination upstream
# routing. Replaces the single `network.upstream_proxy` string as the expressive form —
# that scalar stays as the implicit catch-all, so an existing settings.json keeps working
# byte-for-byte. See settings.cr for the module-level load/save/serialize orchestration.
#
# WHY a table: one global proxy address cannot say "route *.corp.internal through the
# internal proxy, everything else direct", cannot carry credentials (so gori was unusable
# behind an authenticating proxy at all), and can choose different proxies per destination.
module Gori::Settings
  # The one spelling of "an HTTP CONNECT proxy reached over TLS". It is a rule `kind` AND a
  # scalar/project URI scheme, because those two grammars name the same transport and a second
  # word for it is how they drift (the same argument `Proxy::Socks5` makes for the SOCKS
  # vocabulary gori speaks at both ends).
  #
  # WHY NOT `https://`: that scheme is already taken. It has meant a PLAINTEXT HTTP CONNECT
  # proxy since before gori could speak TLS to a proxy at all, and every settings.json that
  # carries one means exactly that. Redefining it would silently move an existing operator's
  # egress onto a handshake their proxy may not even offer, on upgrade, with no edit — so
  # `https://` keeps its meaning, `http+tls://` is the new, explicit spelling, and
  # `upstream_proxy_warnings` says so out loud at startup for anyone who wrote the ambiguous
  # one. `+` is legal in a scheme (RFC 3986 §3.1) and reads as what it is: the HTTP proxy
  # protocol, carried over TLS.

  #
  # Credentials: only `username` and `password_env` are ever stored, where `password_env` is
  # the NAME of an OS environment variable. The password itself is never written to
  # settings.json — deliberately. gori's own `env` section is NOT used for this: those vars
