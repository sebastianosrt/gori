# LISTENERS section (settings.json "listeners"): ADDITIONAL sockets the proxy accepts on,
# alongside the primary `network.bind_host`/`bind_port`. See settings.cr for the load/save
# orchestration.
#
# The primary bind deliberately stays a scalar rather than becoming element 0 of this array.
# It is not "an address gori listens on" — it is THE FORWARD-PROXY ENDPOINT A CLIENT IS
# CONFIGURED AGAINST, and that is singular by construction. The status bar, the statusline
# JSON, the CA-download page, the self-loop refusal, `CaptureStatus` and the live rebind all
# keep answering about it; the additional listeners here are an INVENTORY, never element 0 of
# a merged list. See #499 for the full argument, which is worth summarising because it is not
# what the original version of this comment claimed:
#
#   - The CA page and the self-loop refusal are ALREADY per-listener — both ride `self_addr`,
#     the accepting `Proxy::Server`'s own address (`server.cr:161-162`), and the page prefers
#     the concrete address the device reached (`client_conn.cr:1371-1373`). A plural model
#     would have regressed them from exactly right to right-on-average.
#   - The statusline `proxy` object and `CaptureStatus` are contracts read OUTSIDE this
#     process (a user's script; another gori instance's project picker). Turning either scalar
#     into an array breaks them for no new information — the statusline already solved this
#     shape additively when upstream routing stopped being singular.
#   - The `listen` chip is a CONTROL (a click toggles capture), so a plural chip would have no
#     defined click target.
#
# The asymmetry is real rather than cosmetic: gori can move the primary bind under the
# operator (`server.cr:63-75`, the fallback ladder), so it has to be announced. Every address
# in this array was typed here by the operator, so it only has to be confirmed.
module Gori::Settings
  # proxy       — an ordinary forward proxy: clients send absolute-form requests or CONNECT.
  #               Use it to expose a second address (e.g. a LAN interface for a phone) without
  #               widening the primary bind to 0.0.0.0.
  # transparent — the client believes it is talking to the origin. There is no CONNECT and no
  #               absolute-form target, so the destination is recovered per connection: the
  #               kernel's own record of what the client dialled before the redirect
  #               (`Proxy::OrigDst`) where it can be read, and the `Host` header / TLS SNI
  #               otherwise. Requires the kernel to redirect traffic here (pf / iptables
  #               REDIRECT). Where either mode would work, `reverse` is simpler: it DECLARES the
  #               destination and needs no kernel rule and no recovery at all.
  # reverse     — the client believes it is talking to the origin, and the origin is DECLARED
  #               (`origin`) rather than derived. Same pinned-destination path as transparent
  #               with none of the derivation's failure modes, and no kernel rule: the client
  #               just has to reach this socket. This is what makes gori usable against a
  #               client that cannot be pointed at a proxy at all.
  # socks5      — a SOCKS5 proxy (RFC 1928): the client asks for a destination by name and gori
  #               MITMs what follows, exactly as on the transparent path but with the
  #               destination DECLARED by the client rather than recovered from the kernel, an
  #               SNI or a `Host` header. For the client that can be pointed at a proxy but not
  #               at an HTTP one — an `ALL_PROXY=socks5://` tool, a runtime whose only proxy
  #               setting is SOCKS. gori already speaks the other end of this protocol
  #               (`upstream_rules`, kind `socks5`); this is the same vocabulary,
  #               inbound. NO-AUTH only, like the `proxy` listener beside it.

  # One additional listener. `target_port` is the port gori dials upstream for a TRANSPARENT
  # connection when the kernel will not say — the redirect rule's intent, declared, so the
  # listener taking redirected :443 traffic sets 443. Ignored in proxy mode.
  #
  # It is now ADVISORY rather than the only answer: `Proxy::OrigDst` reads the original
  # destination off the socket (SO_ORIGINAL_DST on Linux, a pf DIOCNATLOOK on macOS) and that
  # answer OUTRANKS this field, because it is the port the client actually dialled rather than a
  # description of the rule that redirected it. It still has to exist, and is still the only
  # answer, everywhere the lookup cannot reach: a platform with neither mechanism, a macOS gori
  # not running as root (`/dev/pf` is 0600 root:wheel), and a connection made straight to the
  # listener with no redirect in front of it.
  #
  # Kept REFUSED in every non-transparent mode below for the same reason as before: accepting it
  # silently would ignore the field. Advisory is not the same as meaningless.
  #
  # `origin` is the REVERSE listener's declared destination, as an absolute URL
  # ("https://api.example.com", "http://127.0.0.1:3000"). Deliberately NOT `target_port`
  # reused: that field answers a different question (which port a DERIVED host should be
  # dialled on) and `listener_error` already refuses it in the wrong mode rather than
  # ignoring it. Reusing it would have meant one field with two meanings selected by `mode`,
  # which is the thing that precedent exists to prevent.
