  # ON by default: she is part of what gori looks like, not an extra someone has to find.
  # She covers three rows of the body's bottom-right corner and — unique among gori's
  # chrome — costs periodic repaints while someone is at the keyboard (~1/s on "lively",
  # ~0.3/s on "calm"; zero once she dozes off after 90s of inactivity). Everyone who does
  # not want that says so ONCE: turning her off no longer matches the factory default, so
  # serialize_companion writes `"enabled": false` and the answer survives every upgrade.
  # (Under the old default the same answer was written by omitting the section, which is
  # why this flip reaches an install that declined her in the wizard.) The two costs have
  # a setting each short of turning her off: motion "still" drops every repaint she starts
  # herself, and placement "bar" gives the three body rows back.

  # "lively" = blinks, winks, a glint sweep, and about every 25 seconds one of seven idle
  # gestures (a yawn, a smile, a squint, a deadpan, a curious look, a huff, an "hmm").
  # "calm" halves the blink rate and drops the rest — for SSH sessions and battery.
  # "still" drops the blink too, so nothing she does on her own moves at all: #compose
  # then returns the same frame on every beat and #tick reports a change exactly never
  # while she is idle. That is for an asciinema recording, a screen reader, a shared tmux
  # pane and anywhere a repainting corner is noise rather than company — and it is a
  # THIRD mode rather than a second meaning for "calm", because someone who picked calm
  # asked for a quieter mascot, not for a still image.
  #
  # Her REACTIONS to results are not motion she starts on her own, so all three modes play
  # them, arc and all (tui/companion.cr#pose_for). "still" is the one exception, and only
  # for the part of a reaction that is literally movement: the :error shudder displaces
  # her a column, so it is suppressed while the face change it accompanies is not.

  # is the one notice written TO the operator, and the only live copy of it: an agent that
