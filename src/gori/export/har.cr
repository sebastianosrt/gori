module Gori
  # Write captured flows OUT in an interchange format — the inverse direction of
  # `Gori::Import`, which reads six formats and (before #495) wrote none.
  module Export
    # HAR 1.2 writer: `Store::FlowDetail` → one HAR entry.
    #
    # Read this alongside `Import::Har` and `Import::Builder`. A HAR gori writes must
    # import back into gori as the same flow, so every field here is chosen for what the
    # import side does with it on the way back in, not just for what the spec allows:
    #
    #   * `url` is `FlowRow#url` because `Builder.endpoint` re-derives scheme/host/port/
    #     target from exactly that string.
    #   * `httpVersion` is the stored version verbatim, which is what
    #     `Import::Har.normalize_http_version` maps back onto itself.
    #   * headers are emitted in WIRE ORDER, duplicates kept (`Builder::Headers` is an
    #     ordered list for the same reason: a Hash would collapse repeated Set-Cookie).
    #   * bodies are the STORED WIRE BYTES, not the decompressed view — see `body_note`.
    #
    # Two things the import side normalizes, so a re-imported head is not byte-identical to
    # the captured one (the flow is, its serialization is not):
    #   * `Builder.request_head` re-emits `Content-Length` LAST, after every other header,
    #     and upcases the method.
    #   * `Codec::Http1.parse_headers` strips the field-value, so `Name:  v ` comes back
    #     as `Name: v`.
    #   * A plain-HTTP forward-proxy request is captured in ABSOLUTE form
    #     (`GET http://h:8099/p HTTP/1.1` — the wire truth, P7) and HAR carries only a
    #     `url`, with no way to record which form the request line took. `Builder.endpoint`
    #     re-imports it as origin-form, so the re-imported request line — and with it
    #     `headersSize` — is shorter by the authority. Nothing else moves, and the proxy
    #     rewrites absolute→origin on forward anyway.
    # For a COMPLETE flow everything a HAR carries — method (its exact case included), url,
    # version, ordered headers with their framing, body bytes, status, reason, timing —
    # survives, and export→import→export is a fixed point apart from the absolute-form
    # request line and the `headersSize` that follows from it, above. A flow that is NOT
    # complete has no fixed point to be: HAR records neither `state` nor gori's `error`
    # string, so a pending / refused / aborted flow is SKIPPED by name and counted
    # (`skip_reason`), never written as a fabricated success.
    #
    # A WebSocket flow is the one entry that carries more than an HTTP exchange: the handshake
    # is written as itself and the captured messages ride beside it in Chrome's
    # `_webSocketMessages` (see WS_MESSAGES). Those round-trip too — `Import::Har` reads them
    # back into `ws_messages` — with two named exceptions stated where they are made: the
    # frame SHAPE has no field in the format (`ws_messages`), and a message time keeps
    # millisecond fidelity (`epoch_seconds`), matching `startedDateTime`.
    #
    # "The handshake as itself" is load-bearing, and since #733 it is not always a 101. A
    # WebSocket opened over HTTP/2 (RFC 8441 §5.1) has no `Upgrade:` exchange to write: its
    # handshake is `CONNECT /path HTTP/2` answered `200`, with the `:protocol: websocket`
    # pseudo-header on the request. gori writes that entry with the method, the status and the
    # `X-Gori-Protocol` marker line it really had, plus `_webSocketMessages` and
    # `_resourceType: "websocket"` beside them. Chrome's extension is defined on the ENTRY and
    # keys nothing off the status, so this is a legal HAR that says what happened; what it is
    # NOT is a shape Chrome itself can emit, because DevTools has no h2 WebSocket to export.
    # The alternative — writing a synthetic `101 Switching Protocols` so the entry looks like
    # the h1 one — would put a response on the record that no origin ever sent, and
    # `Import::Har` would read it straight back as a flow that never existed. The honest entry
    # is the one with a CONNECT in it.
    module Har
      SPEC_VERSION = "1.2"

      # HAR 1.2 has no "this body is incomplete" field, and a capture-capped body
      # (`Settings.capture_max`, 2 MiB by default) is exactly that. Two things carry it:
      #
      #   1. `bodySize` / `content.size` stay the TRUE wire size while `text` carries only
      #      the bytes gori captured, so `size` is larger than the body in the file. That
      #      IS what the spec means by those fields — the size of the body on the wire, not
      #      the length of the string written here — so a reader that checks them (including
      #      `Import::Har`, which restores the truncation from them) sees the shortfall
      #      without needing a gori-specific extension.
      #   2. An explicit `comment` on the `content` / `postData` object, prefixed with
      #      TRUNCATED_MARK so it is greppable, for readers that only look at the text.
      #
      # Emitting `size` == the emitted text length instead would hand a teammate a HAR that
      # presents a capped body as a complete one: the silent-no-op class this repo has had
      # to fix over and over (#488/#489/#491). The CLI additionally counts these and says so
      # on STDERR, so the caveat is visible without opening the file.

      # or an h2 pseudo-header is stored as raw octets and `Codec::Http1.parse_headers` keeps
      # them that way on purpose (P7). A HAR is JSON and JSON is UTF-8 (RFC 8259), and unlike a
      # BODY there is no lossless escape hatch for a head — `emit_body` can fall back to
      # base64, a header name cannot — so those octets become U+FFFD here. That is a real loss,
      # so it is named on the entry rather than left silent (#488/#489/#491).

      #
      # gori writes it because the alternative was worse in both directions. Skipping every 101
      # (what this did until now) throws away the entire point of capturing a socket, and the
      # obvious repair — folding the messages into a fabricated HTTP body — writes an exchange
      # that never happened and imports back as one. The handshake IS a real request and a real
      # response, so it is written as itself and the transcript rides beside it in the field a
      # HAR reader already knows.
