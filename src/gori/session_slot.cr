module Gori
  # A named SESSION SLOT: one identity's worth of auth state, as a static header overlay
  # plus the extract rules whose bindings belong to it.
  #
  # gori had no multi-session primitive: `Env` is one value per key and `Bindings` was a
  # single process-global namespace, so `Authorize` shipped its own tiny "identity" — a
  # header overlay it applied to a captured request before replaying it. That type and a
  # session slot are the SAME THING under two names, and keeping them apart would have made
  # "the admin session" mean one thing in the Authorize tab and another at a Repeater send.
  # So they are one struct, persisted once (`SessionSlot.serialize`, under
  # `Store::SESSION_SLOTS_KEY`, which is still the `authorize_identities` row an existing
  # project already has). `Authorize::Identity` is an alias of this.
  #
  # Three fields and no more:
  #
  #   * `set_headers` upsert (replace any existing header of that name, case-insensitively;
  #     append when absent) and `remove_headers` strip. An "anonymous" slot removes
  #     Cookie/Authorization; an "admin" slot sets them. The overlay is HEADER-ONLY, so
  #     Content-Length never moves — that invariant is what lets a slot be applied to bytes
  #     the operator never intended to reframe.
  #   * `rules` names the extract rules (by binding NAME — `extract_rules.name` is UNIQUE, so
  #     a name IS a rule) whose observed values land in THIS slot's binding table rather than
  #     the one global table. A rule no slot names stays unscoped and keeps writing the global
  #     table, which is what makes every playbook written before slots existed keep working.
  #
  # There is deliberately NO cookie jar here. A slot is a static overlay plus a namespace for
  # values gori already observes; RFC 6265 storage, path/domain matching and expiry are a
  # different feature with a different failure mode, and the 90% case an operator actually
  # asks for is "send these headers as this identity".
  #
  # Exactly one slot in an Authorize run is the BASELINE — usually the request as-captured
  # (its own session), which the others are judged against.
