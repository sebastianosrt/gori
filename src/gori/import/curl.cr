  module Import
    # A pasted `curl` command, turned into the request it describes (#1244) — the inverse of
    # `Export::Curl`, and the two are held to a round trip: a request exported as curl and
    # imported back is the same bytes (`spec/curl_round_trip_spec.cr`).
    #
    # It PARSES and never runs anything. `Shell` splits the text into words; this maps curl's
    # flags onto a request head and body, following CURL's meaning of each flag, not
    # `gori run send`'s: there `-b` is a body, here it is a cookie, because Chrome's "Copy as
    # cURL" emits cookies with `-b` and a pasted browser command must not have its cookies
    # turned into a request body.
    #
    # WHAT COMES OUT is the request curl would put on the wire, minus the two headers curl adds
    # to identify ITSELF (`User-Agent: curl/…`, `Accept: */*`). Those describe the client that
    # ran the command, not the request the command describes — and the round trip needs them
    # gone: a capture without a User-Agent exports without a `-H` for one, and must not come
    # back carrying curl's. Everything a flag says is kept, measured against curl 8.7.1 on a
    # raw listener:
    #
    #   -H 'N: v'      the line exactly as typed, in argv order — spacing included (P7)
    #   -H 'N:'        curl's "do not send N": drops a header gori would otherwise add
    #   -H 'N;'        N with an empty value (`N:` on the wire)
    #   -d/--data*     the body; several are joined with `&`; POST unless -X says otherwise;
    #                  `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` after Content-Length
    #                  when no -H names one
    #   --json         the body joined with nothing, plus Content-Type/Accept: application/json
    #   -F/--form-string  a multipart body with a fresh boundary
    #   -G             the data goes to the query instead, as a GET
    #   -u, URL user:pass  `Authorization: Basic …`; a -H Authorization wins
    #   -A -e -b -r --compressed --oauth2-bearer  the header each one means
    #   -X             the method, verbatim — curl validates nothing here and neither does this
    #   --request-target  the request-target, verbatim
    #
    # Every header lands in the order its flag appears, with `Host:` synthesized first when
    # none is given and `Content-Length` synthesized last. That is the operator's order (the
    # browser's, for a copied command), and it is what makes the round trip exact.
    #
    # REFUSED, with the reason: a URL curl itself would refuse (whitespace, a control byte),
    # a non-http scheme, and anything that reads a LOCAL FILE (`-d @f`, `-F n=@f`, `-T`, `-K`,
    # `-H @f`) — the paste does not carry the file, and inventing its contents is not an option.
    #
    # IGNORED, and named: transport and output flags (`-k`, `-s`, `-L`, `-x`, `--resolve`,
    # timeouts…). gori sends through its own network settings, so these change nothing about
    # the request; each import reports which were dropped.
