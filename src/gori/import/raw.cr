    # Ingest for formats that carry a RAW HTTP message (the wire bytes) rather than a
    # structured description of one — today that means Burp's item export.
    #
    # `Builder` is a SERIALIZER: it takes {method, target, headers, body} and writes a head.
    # Round-tripping raw bytes through it would normalize the head, re-emit Content-Length
    # and reject the entry on `Builder::HEADER_INJECT` — destroying exactly what makes a
    # saved Burp item worth importing, since those are frequently hand-forged requests. So
    # this path stores the head BYTE-EXACT and only derives the storage projections, which
    # is the same stance the imported request TARGET already takes (#400, DESIGN.md §7).
    module Raw
      # `url` supplies scheme/host/port ONLY. The target comes from the raw request-line, so
      # a smuggling payload in the path survives import verbatim; the URL is just how we
      # learn which origin the operator captured it from.
