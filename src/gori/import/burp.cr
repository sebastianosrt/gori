    # Burp Suite's "Save items" XML export (Proxy history / Site map / Repeater tabs →
    # right-click → Save items). Each `<item>` carries the full raw request and response as
    # base64, which is why this is the only import source that reproduces a captured flow
    # byte-for-byte instead of rebuilding one from parts (see `Import::Raw`).
    #
    # Deliberately parsed with a string scanner rather than `require "xml"`. libxml2 is not
    # currently linked into gori, and pulling it in would mean adding `libxml2-dev` +
    # `libxml2-static` (and its transitive static deps) to every packaging path that builds
    # `--static` — packaging/docker/Dockerfile, the release workflow, flake.nix, Homebrew,
    # AUR, snap — for one import format. Burp's export is machine-generated with a fixed, flat shape, so
    # a scanner is sufficient and, as a side effect, has no XXE or entity-expansion surface
    # at all. The bound: this is NOT a general XML parser. Namespaced, re-ordered or
    # hand-edited variants (and Logger++/other third-party exports) are out of scope.

        # file is a scrub of the wire bytes — and this importer's whole reason to exist is
        # that those bytes survive. It used to `raw = raw.scrub unless raw.valid_encoding?`
        # on the theory that scrubbing "keeps the scanner's ASCII needles working"; the
        # scanner never needed it. It works in BYTE offsets (`byte_index`, `byte_slice`), and
        # every needle is ASCII — a byte that can never sit inside a multibyte character — so
        # invalid UTF-8 around a tag cannot move one, and `byte_slice` copies the bytes between
        # tags exactly as they are.
        #
        # What the scrub actually did, measured through `gori run import --burp` into a real
        # store on a source body `a=1&bin=<ff fe 01 02>&b=2`:

        #
        # — 20 bytes under a stored head still declaring `Content-Length: 16`, reported as
        # `count: 1, skipped: 0`. The store IS the evidence, so that loss was permanent.
        #
