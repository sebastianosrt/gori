    # A small, namespace-aware XML tree reader — enough of XML 1.0 + XML Names to read a
    # WSDL and the XML Schema inside it, and deliberately no more.
    #
    # WHY NOT `require "xml"`. libxml2 is not linked into gori, and linking it would mean
    # adding `libxml2-dev` + `libxml2-static` (and its transitive static deps) to every
    # packaging path that builds `--static` — packaging/docker/Dockerfile, the release
    # workflow, flake.nix, Homebrew, AUR, snap. `import/burp.cr` states the same reasoning for its
    # flat scanner; this is that decision applied to a document that actually needs a tree.
    #
    # WHY NOT `Import::Burp`'s scanner. That one matches `<name` by string index over a
    # machine-generated, flat, prefix-free export. A WSDL breaks all three assumptions: the
    # same element arrives as `<wsdl:portType>`, `<portType>` or `<w:portType>` depending on
    # the generator; every cross-reference is a QName carried in an ATTRIBUTE VALUE
    # (`type="tns:Foo"`) resolved against prefixes bound arbitrarily far up the tree; and
    # `<xsd:sequence>` nests recursively. Prefix-blind matching silently mis-resolves.
    #
    # WHAT IT IS NOT. No DTD, no external entities, no XInclude, no namespace fixup, no
    # schema validation, no round-trip serialization. It reads a document into nodes.
