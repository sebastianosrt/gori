      # A raw control byte (CR, LF, other C0 or DEL) in the PATH or QUERY of an imported
      # URL is NOT rejected: it is the operator's own payload. Importing a HAR of a deliberately
      # CRLF-bearing request — a smuggling case — is exactly what a security-testing proxy is
      # for, so the entry is stored and replayed byte-exact, never sanitised (P7; DESIGN.md §7).
      # URI.parse copies a literal control byte verbatim into `path`/`query`, and `request_head`
      # writes the target onto the request line as-is, which faithfully reproduces the operator's
      # forged message on the wire — the point, not a defect. (Header/method/version smuggling is
      # a DIFFERENT boundary and keeps its own guards below; see HEADER_INJECT.)
      #
      # KNOWN GAP — NUL (0x00) is the one exception, and it is NOT byte-exact today. Crystal's
      # `URI.parse` truncates `path` and `query` at a NUL, so an imported
      # `http://h/nul\0byte` stores target `/nul` and the payload tail is silently lost — no
      # skip, no warning. CR and LF are unaffected and do round-trip verbatim as described
      # above. Verified against 0.2.0; `URI.parse("http://h/p?a=b\0c").query == "a=b"`. The same
      # round-trip truncates the wire target in the proxy's absolute-form rewrite
      # (`Proxy::Conn::ClientConn#resolve_forward` → `origin_form`), so a fix belongs with that
      # one, not here. Until then, do not read the paragraph above as covering NUL.

      # The HOST is the one place import still rejects malformed bytes, because there they
      # mean the string is not a URL at all — a parse failure, not a URL describing a malformed
      # request. URI.parse copies a reg-name authority into `host` VERBATIM without validating it,
      # so a `--urls`/HAR line like `not a url at all` becomes a stored "host" of literal spaces
      # instead of being skipped the way `ftp://…` and empty URLs already are. Userinfo, port and
      # the `://` sit outside `uri.host`, so what is left is a reg-name, an IPv4 literal, punycode,
      # or a BRACKETED IP literal — and nothing else. Reject anything else in `endpoint`, at the
      # same raise-to-skip point the scheme/shape checks use.
      #
      # This was a C0/space/DEL blacklist and that was far too narrow: `normalize_url` prepends
      # `https://` to ANY line, so feeding a JSON document to `--urls` (`gori run import --urls
      # cap.har`, the flag typo that actually happens) turned its punctuation into 120 stored
      # flows with hosts `{`, `},` and `],`, reported as a successful import, and polluted
      # History / Sitemap / scope with fabricated `https://{/` endpoints. A whitelist is the
      # right shape here: `}` and `{` are not the point, "a host is a narrow thing" is. RFC 3986
      # also permits sub-delims (`!$&'()*+,;=`) in a reg-name; they are excluded deliberately,
      # because no http(s) authority in the wild carries one and allowing `,` alone is what let
      # `],` through. `%` stays for percent-encoded IDN forms and `_` for the illegal-but-common
      # underscore label. Callers that want a BETTER message for a specific shape still check
      # first (`Vars.unresolved` for `{{baseUrl}}`, `Oas`/`Postman`/`Insomnia`); this is the
      # backstop, not their replacement.
      #
      # The reg-name half is `\p{L}\p{N}`, not `A-Za-z0-9`, because a host is not an ASCII
      # thing: `URI.parse` copies an IDN authority through in whatever form the source wrote
      # it, and gori CAPTURES and stores the Unicode form. An ASCII-only whitelist meant gori
      # could not read its own HAR export back — `https://쇼핑몰.한국/…` exported fine and
      # re-imported as a skipped, malformed entry, against `Export::Har`'s stated fixed point.

      # apart:
      #
      #   * a gori-written HAR carries the WIRE body (`export/har.cr` writes the wire form on
      #     purpose), so a chunked flow round-trips with its framing intact — and synthesizing
      #     a Content-Length beside the TE produced the CL+TE shape gori's own
      #     `Codec::Body.request_framing` REJECTS as illegal, out of a flow captured legally;
      #   * a browser / Charles / Postman HAR passes `transfer-encoding: chunked` through
      #     verbatim while `content.text` is the DECODED body. Trusting the header alone there
      #     stores a head declaring `Chunked` over a body that is not, which every consumer
      #     (Repeater replay, `gori run` reconstruct, re-export) then misframes — silently,
      #     where the CL+TE at least got refused loudly.
      #
      # So the BODY decides and the head is made to describe what is actually stored: keep the
      # TE when the bytes back it, otherwise drop the header and state the real length.
      #
      # `truncated` is the third case: a chunked body the SOURCE says was cut short (a gori
      # capture capped at `Settings.capture_max`, marked in the HAR by a `bodySize` larger
      # than the text it ships). Those octets can never reach a zero chunk, so the strict
      # walk called them "not chunked", dropped the Transfer-Encoding and stated a
      # Content-Length over raw chunk framing — the head-lies-about-body misframe this
