    # (docs/content/guide/proxy.md promises "no restart" for Rewriter; Scope has the
    # same expectation — its Sandbox gate is enforced off this SAME live object). The TUI
    # gets Rewriter on demand via the `r` key (Rewriter::rewriter_reload) and Scope via its
    # own store data_version poll (Runner#apply_external_change); headless has neither a
    # keyboard nor that poll, so it re-reads both on a timer instead. A couple of seconds

    # CAPTURE_SIGNALS by construction — every signal headless capture handles is handled
    # here too, and HUP is the one the TUI adds. HUP is TUI-only because only this path
    # leaves a terminal's line discipline altered: an SSH drop delivers HUP to a gori whose
    # tmux/screen session OUTLIVES it, so the pane is handed back in raw mode with the
    # alternate screen and SGR-1006 mouse reporting still on and only `reset` recovers it.
    # `gori run capture` never touched the tty, so its exit-on-HUP costs at most a partial
    # line — and trapping it there would silently turn a documented 129 into a 0.

    # Why NOT run_capture's orderly `@shutdown` channel: that works there because capture's
    # MAIN fiber is already parked on `@shutdown.receive`, so the send wakes the very fiber
    # that owns the teardown. The TUI's main fiber is inside Runner's event loop, which App
    # holds no channel into, and a `Signal.trap` body runs on its OWN fiber — it cannot
    # unwind someone else's stack, so it can never reach `run_tui`'s `ensure term.close`.
    # An orderly handler here would therefore restore nothing AND not exit. So the handler
    # does the teardown itself and then dies FROM the signal under the default disposition,
    # which keeps the exit status the conventional 128+signo (143 TERM / 130 INT / 129 HUP)
    # that `pkill`, a wrapper script or a supervisor reads.
    #
    # Nothing else is torn down, deliberately. The store is SQLite in WAL mode (crash-safe —
    # the next open recovers) and the capture lock is a BSD flock the kernel frees when the
    # process dies (capture_lock.cr: "freed by the kernel on close / exit"), so neither needs
    # a store call from the signal fiber while the main fiber may be mid-write. A hang here
    # would be strictly worse than the bug: it turns "killed with a wrecked terminal" into
    # "not killed at all".
    #
    # `arm` and `die` are injected because both are process-global and unspeccable for real:
    # a trap installed by an example leaks into every later one, and the real `die` takes the
    # suite down with it. Production `arm` installs a ONE-SHOT trap — it resets the signal to
    # its default disposition BEFORE running the handler, so if `restore` ever hangs a second
    # `pkill` still kills us instead of finding gori unkillable short of SIGKILL.
