module Gori
  module MCP
    # WHICH revision of MCP this server speaks, and how one request says which one it means.
    #
    # MCP has two eras. Through `2025-11-25` a session opens with an `initialize` handshake
    # and every message after it inherits the version negotiated there. `2026-07-28` removed
    # the handshake: the protocol is stateless, each request carries its own version and the
    # client's capabilities in `_meta`, every result names its `resultType`, and
    # `server/discover` is the one RPC a server MUST implement so a client can ask what it is
    # talking to before it commits to anything.
    #
    # gori is DUAL-ERA, which is the shape the spec itself prescribes for serving both: a
    # request carrying modern per-request metadata is answered under `2026-07-28`, an
    # `initialize` selects legacy semantics for the client that sent it, and the two coexist
    # in one process. The era decides the ENVELOPE — `resultType`, `_meta` server identity,
    # cache hints — and never what a tool does: `tools/call` dispatches into the same handler
    # either way, so there is no second surface to keep in step (DESIGN.md §2).
    #
    # The era is read per request and never latched, because under the modern revision there
    # is nothing to latch it to: "an open connection is not a session", and a client may
    # interleave requests from unrelated conversations on one stdio process.

      # Handshake revisions. gori's surface (initialize / tools.list / tools.call / ping) is
      # identical across all four — it uses none of the features that separate them
      # (resources, prompts, sampling, elicitation, tasks) — so each is answered by echoing
      # it back rather than by negotiating down.

      # already opened a handshake session and cannot switch.

      # answer is "until this process ends", which is not expressible. Five minutes is the
      # compromise: it spares a long agent session the re-fetch, and an operator who restarts
      # gori with a different `--tools` sees the new catalogue within one.
      TOOLS_LIST_TTL_MS = 300_000

      # operator's `--tools`-narrowed catalogue, or another project's instructions, to a
