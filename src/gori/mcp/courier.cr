module Gori::MCP
  # Carries operator messages from the project's event feed to THIS server's client session
  # (#1090). One per `gori mcp` process, started once the client says `initialized`, stopped
  # when the reader hits EOF.
  #
  # Four routes, tried in order of what can be CONFIRMED, and only a confirmed one retires a
  # message from the poll backstop (`AgentDelivery::CARRIED`): the socket write either lands or
  # reports why, so it carries the message; the channel push cannot be confirmed, so it does
  # NOT — a session that was not launched with channels drops the frame without a word, and the
  # message must stay readable through `operator_messages` rather than vanish. The cost of that
  # safety is that a channel which DOES work may be read a second time by a polling agent; the
  # silent-loss it prevents is the worse outcome, and channels are an opt-in preview besides.
  #   1. the session's inbox socket (`ClaudeInbox`) — GA, no flags, framed as a peer's note; a
  #      write that lands carries the message and retires it.
  #   2. `codex queue` against the parent Codex session's own thread (`CodexQueue`) — the same
  #      bargain as the socket through a different door: the CLI accepts the line or says why
  #      not, so an accepted hand-off carries the message.
  #   3. a `notifications/claude/channel` frame on this JSON-RPC stream — only when the
  #      capability was DECLARED at this session's handshake (the operator's
  #      `Settings.mcp_channels` as it stood then, latched by the server), and only when neither
  #      door above answered. A best-effort nudge: the delivery row reads "got it (channel)",
  #      but the message is left for poll all the same.
  #   4. nothing — the row stays in the feed for `operator_messages` and the tool-result carry
  #      (`Tools#pending_operator_note`), and a poll deposit row says so.
  # Never two for one message: `deliver` returns on the first route that takes it, and the
  # other two readers of the same feed — the tool-result carry and `operator_messages`, both on
  # `Tools` — stand down while a hand-off is in flight (`claim`/`release`). The durable
  # delivery row is what answers once the hand-off returns; the claim is what answers before it
  # does, which for a `codex queue` is ten seconds of `Process.run`.
  # Each recipient gets its own delivery row (a broadcast has one per session), which is what
  # the TUI turns into "→ claude-code got it (socket)" in the notification ring.
  #
  # The cursor starts at the feed's high-water mark when the courier starts: a client that
  # attaches later is not handed what the operator said before it arrived. The store is
  # re-read on every tick through `store` (a `switch_project` swaps it), and a swap resets
  # the cursor to the new feed's end for the same reason.
  #
  # Runs on its own fiber and never touches the reader's: a store error or a refused socket
  # costs one tick, not the session (`work_loop`'s rule).

    #     be first, so an operator who turned the preview on got it INSTEAD of the inbox socket
    #     — and a Claude Code session that was not launched with the development-channels flag
    #     then had its one waking route taken away by a setting whose own description says the
    #     push rides "on top of" it. The channel is what answers when no confirmed door is open,
    #     which is the only case where an unverifiable push beats nothing at all. Nothing is
    #     lost for a session that DOES hold a channel: the socket reaches the same session, and
    #     unlike the push it retires the message instead of leaving it for a second reading.
    #   - A route that FAILS falls through instead of ending the chain. A socket path that
    #     exists is not a session that is listening — `/tmp/cc-socks/<pid>.sock` outlives the
    #     process that bound it, and pids are reused — so a `gori mcp` under some other client
    #     can find a dead Claude socket at its parent's pid. Committing to it cost the hand-off
