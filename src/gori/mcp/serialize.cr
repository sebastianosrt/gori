      # It exists because `redact_head` cannot tell the two apart. A repeater row stores what
      # the author typed (see `MCP::Tools#stored_request`), so a session wired to an env var
      # holds the literal bytes `Authorization: Bearer $AUTH` — and `redact_head` blanks that
      # to `[REDACTED]` exactly as it blanks a live token. The operator then cannot confirm
      # which key is wired into a request without asking for `include_sensitive`, i.e. without
      # asking for the secret. This is the additive answer:
      #
      #     Authorization: Bearer $AUTH     ← env-bound, and readable

      # `list_env` already publishes), a cookie NAME (an identifier every response and every
