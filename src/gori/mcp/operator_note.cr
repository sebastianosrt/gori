module Gori::MCP
  # How the operator's line is worded on its way to an agent's own session (#1090).
  #
  # Every live route carries the SAME sentence — a Claude Code inbox socket, a `claude/channel`
  # event, a `codex queue` hand-off — because the thing that needs saying does not change with
  # the transport: who is speaking, that gori is only the relay, and where the answer goes.
  # It lives here rather than beside one of those routes so adding the next client is a new
  # delivery module and not a second, drifting copy of the wording.
  #
  # A relayed line is a sentence, not a payload: the flows themselves stay in the store, and
  # the agent fetches them. What the sentence must carry is everything the row holds that the
  # agent cannot get back once a carrying route retires it — which is why the marked ids and
  # the message id are in it, and the bodies are not.
  module OperatorNote
    # Every message ends with where the answer goes. The handshake instructions say the same
    # thing once; a model answering in its own pane while the operator waits in gori was the
    # first thing the live test showed, and a sentence on the message itself is what the
    # model actually has in front of it when it decides how to answer.

    #
    # The marked flows and the message id ride along because a route that carries the message
    # RETIRES it: once the socket write or the `codex queue` hand-off lands, `operator_messages`
    # stops answering with that row, and everything the row held that is not in this sentence
    # becomes unreachable. The text alone was enough while the poll layer was still holding the
    # same message for the same session; it is not enough for a session whose only copy is this
    # one. Ids, not a payload — the flows themselves are still fetched with `get_flow` /
    # `list_history{ids}`.
