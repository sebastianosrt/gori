    # A Model Context Protocol server over stdio: JSON-RPC 2.0, one compact JSON
    # message per line on `input`, responses on `output`. STDOUT is the protocol
    # channel — callers MUST keep it pure (logs go to STDERR). IO is injectable so
    # the server is unit-testable with IO::Memory.
    #
    # TWO fibers, and the split is deliberate. The READER parses lines; a WORKER runs the
    # requests, one at a time, in arrival order — so the tools layer keeps the
    # single-call-at-a-time semantics every one of its handlers is written against, and
    # responses keep coming back in the order they were asked for. What the split buys is
    # that the reader is never parked inside a tool: `ping` and `notifications/cancelled`
    # used to queue behind a five-minute fuzz run, which is exactly when a client's
    # liveness probe fires and exactly when it must not time out — a client that decides
    # the server is dead kills it mid-call and loses the work it was waiting for.
