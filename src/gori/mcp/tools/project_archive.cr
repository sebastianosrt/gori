      # Import archive (#1271). Both tools are thin adapters over the one archive engine,
      # `ProjectArchive`: an agent's export is the same `.gori` file the CLI writes, and an
      # agent's import crosses the same trust boundary (#1264) — executable and file-backed
      # rules disabled, project routing reset, triggers/views refused, the 2 GiB cap — because
      # it is the same `prepare_import`. Paths resolve on the MCP SERVER's filesystem, the
