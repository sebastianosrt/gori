      # --- session slots (named identities: a header overlay + a binding namespace) ---
      #
      # The MCP adapter for `Gori::SessionSlots` — the third surface of the list the TUI's
      # Authorize identities card and `gori run session` already edit. One persisted row, three
      # editors: `authorize_start`'s `identities` default is THIS list, and the ACTIVE slot is
      # what `send_request` / `fuzz_start` / `repeater` go out as.
      #
      # Two halves, and they persist differently on purpose (DESIGN.md §7 2026-08-17):
      #
      #   * the LIST is configuration and lives in the project;
      #   * the ACTIVE pointer is per-PROCESS and never written. For this server that means
      #     `set_active_session_slot` holds for the life of the connection and starts over on
      #     the next one — which is the honest lifetime, because a slot's binding VALUES are
      #     memory-only too, and restoring a pointer into an empty table would hand the next
      #     send an overlay whose `$SESSION` is literal.
      #
      # Every handler goes through the LIVE registry (`slot_registry`), never a fresh
      # `SessionSlots.load`: the live object is the one `Env.layer` resolves `$NAME` against
      # and `Env.overlay_slot` applies at the send seam, so a second copy would let this
      # server report an identity it is not actually sending as.

      # The registry `Env.layer` is wired to, so a write here is visible to the very next
      # send. Nil only when the server never bound a project (`bind_binding_layer` is what
      # installs it) — the tools below are not in `UNBOUND_SAFE`, so `call` has already
      # refused by then; the fallback is a compile-time necessity rather than a live path.
