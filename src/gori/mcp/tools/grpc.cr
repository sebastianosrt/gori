      # --- gRPC schema: server reflection + what is loaded (#823/#827) ----------
      #
      # `grpc_reflect` is an ACTIVE tool: it opens one h2 connection per discovery round to
      # the target and asks its reflection service for descriptors. It therefore sits behind
      # the same two gates every other active tool does — `gated` (an MCP server started
      # `--read-only` has no active tools at all) and `Outbound.agent`, whose Layer 1 refuses
      # anything the project scope does not explicitly include unless the caller passes
      # `allow_unscoped:true`. Neither is advisory: no socket is opened before both answer.
      #
      # It never fires on its own. An agent reading a captured gRPC flow gets the schema-less
      # tree (or a file-loaded lens) until it asks for this, which is P4 in the one place an
      # agent could most easily be surprised by an outbound request.
