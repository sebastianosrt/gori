      # the round trip `intercept_get` starts when it hands back `raw_base64`.
      #
      # `raw` behaves differently depending on WHAT is held, because the two shapes are not the
      # same message:
      #   - An HTTP head+body: lone LFs in the HEADER block become CRLF (a hand-typed message
      #     still frames) while the BODY is left untouched — `RequestBuilder.normalize_raw`,
      #     the same rule `send_request`'s `raw` uses.
      #   - A WebSocket message (`row.ws?`): there IS no header block — no start line, no
      #     headers, no head/body split — so running the HTTP rule on it is not "safe
      #     normalization", it is corruption: with no blank line to bound it, the WHOLE payload
      #     is treated as "header" and every bare LF the operator typed is promoted to CRLF (a
      #     17-byte unedited round trip came back 19 bytes on the wire). `raw` is taken
      #     LITERALLY instead, mirroring the TUI's `@loaded_ws` branch in
      #     `intercept_view#pending_edit` (`wire_bytes`, never `Env.expand_wire`/normalize).
      #   - A WebSocket BINARY frame (`row.binary?`): even taken literally, a JSON string
      #     cannot carry an arbitrary octet — a byte above 0x7F round-trips through JSON's
      #     Unicode text encoding as MULTIPLE bytes, silently growing the payload (`0xFF` came
      #     back `0xC3 0xBF`). The TUI answers the identical problem with a HEX editor over the
      #     payload (`InterceptView#hex_editing?`) — a byte channel, which is what this one is
      #     not — so `raw` refuses here by name instead of forwarding the wrong bytes, and
