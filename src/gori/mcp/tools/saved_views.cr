      # --- History views (#776) ---------------------------------------------------------
      #
      # A view is a named History QL query, applied as a LENS: `list_history{view}` ANDs it over
      # `query` rather than replacing it, exactly as the TUI's `v` picker ANDs it over the filter
      # bar and `gori run history --view` ANDs it over `-q`.
      #
      # Same two-scope model as the colour-rule tools above — a global library in settings.json
      # plus this project's own rows — but addressed by NAME rather than by `{id, scope}`. The
      # name is what `list_history{view}` takes and what the picker shows, so an id would be a
      # second spelling of one thing; `scope` is still carried on every mutation because names
      # are unique only WITHIN a scope.

      # Every view available in this project: the built-ins, then the global library, then the
      # project's own.
