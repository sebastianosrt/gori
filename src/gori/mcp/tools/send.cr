          # produce one. So the rewrite stays the default (every plaintext-HTTP capture needs
          # it), but it is now REPORTED (`request_line_rewritten`) and `keep_request_line`
          # turns it off — the same pair `gori run repeater --keep-request-line` has. Without
          # it an agent had no route to the probe at all: the rewrite was silent and there was
          # no argument to prevent it.

          # Default to how the flow was captured, but honor an EXPLICIT http2 either way —
          # `bool_arg` returns `flow.http2` only when the arg is absent, so `http2:false`
          # can now downgrade an h2 capture to h1 (it used to be silently ignored because
          # `false || flow.http2` kept h2). Carry the captured SNI so an origin where
          # SNI ≠ Host (domain fronting / multi-cert vhost) presents the right certificate,
          # matching `gori run repeater`.
          # `auto_content_length` is deliberately OFF here (it used to default ON, silently):
          # this tool documents a flow replay as byte-exact, and a captured
          # `Content-Length: 99` over a 2-byte body is the CL-desync probe the operator
          # wants re-sent, not a mistake to correct. `resync_cl_after_expansion` keeps the
          # one case that must still recompute — a `$KEY` in the body changing its length.
          #
          # `expand_request` is off here for the one reason `auto_content_length` already was:
          # a captured flow's bytes are EVIDENCE, and the operator authored none of them. It
          # ran `Env.expand_wire`, whose head pass PROMOTES a bare LF to
          #     CRLF. A bare-LF header terminator is a front-end/back-end desync primitive gori
          #     can already produce (`verbatim`) and stores byte-exact; replay silently
          #     destroyed it and still reported a clean send.
          # With expansion off there is no expansion to resync a Content-Length after, so
          # `resync_cl_after_expansion` goes with it: the stored framing ships exactly as
          # captured, which is what a CL/TE desync capture is for.
          # `evidence: true` ALONGSIDE the two flags, not instead of them, and this is the
          # second time that distinction has cost a round. The flags reach the BUILDER;
          # `evidence` is what reaches the SENDER, where a DECLARED session binding is
          # deliberately deferred to (`expand_requests`' own comment says so). Without it an
          # extract rule named `TOKEN`/`filter`/`where` rewrote a stored `GET /api?$TOKEN=1`
          # into `GET /api?SECRETTOKEN123=1` on the wire while this tool still reported the
          # stored target — the exact thing `expand_request: false` was added to stop, one
          # layer further down. `gori run repeater <flow-id>` already passed `evidence: true`,
          # so the two surfaces reached "the same end state" by different mechanisms and only
          # one of them was actually byte-exact.
          #
          # The flags stay because they are NOT implied: `expand_request: false` is also what
          # keeps `downgrade_request_line` off this path, and an `HTTP/2` version line in a
          # capture is the operator's to replay.
          # A capture is replayed byte-exact WITHOUT the flag — `expand_request` and
          # `auto_content_length` are already off below — so field case is the only thing
