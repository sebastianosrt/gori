      # --- authorize (broken access control, async job model) ------------------
      #
      # The MCP adapter for `Authorize::Plan` — one of the three surfaces AGENTS.md §2
      # requires for every tool. Everything that decides WHAT runs (resolving flow ids and a
      # QL query to flows, loading the project's identities, the skip rules, the Layer-1
      # verdict, the engine, the send loop) lives in the seam; what is left here is exactly
      # what is MCP's own: argument shapes, the job registry, the JSON a model reads, and
      # resolving `allow_unscoped` into an `Outbound.agent` — the STRICT Layer-1 gate, because
      # nobody eyeballed this target (DESIGN.md §7).
      #
      # The job model (start → status/results → stop) rather than a synchronous call, because
      # all four other active-sending MCP tools are jobs and an authorize run is the longest
      # of them: it dials a FRESH connection per identity on purpose (`Engine.live`), so a
      # ten-flow selection under three identities is thirty handshakes.
