      # This exists because the other three routes are each ONE client's door: the inbox socket
      # is Claude Code's, `codex queue` is Codex's, the channel is a preview of Claude Code's.
      # Every other MCP client gori installs into (grok, pi, hermes, Antigravity, Claude
      # Desktop) has no door at all — their sessions were surveyed for one — so for them the
      # poll tool was the whole channel, and a poll only works if the model REMEMBERS to call
      # it. The handshake `instructions` that ask it to are delivered once, at initialize, and
      # a model deep in a long session is not reading them any more (#1003 is the same lesson).
