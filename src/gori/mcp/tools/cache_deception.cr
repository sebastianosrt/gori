      # --- cache_deception_check (web cache deception, synchronous) ------------
      #
      # The MCP adapter for `Gori::CacheDeception` (#1247). Synchronous, unlike `authorize_*`:
      # a check uses up to THREE sends for one flow (authenticated, anonymous, then a
      # cache-busted anonymous control), so
      # the job registry the longer authorize/fuzz runs need would be overhead here.
      #
      # It BORROWS the Authorize engine — `Engine.live`, the same scope-gated sender authorize
      # uses — with the identities fixed to as-captured and anonymous. What is MCP's own here is argument shapes, the strict Layer-1 gate
      # (`Outbound.agent`, because no human eyeballed this target), and the JSON a model reads.
      # No `env_refresh`: unlike authorize_start, this replays the request AS CAPTURED (verbatim
      # wire bytes) under built-in identities that carry no `$NAME`/session-slot value to
      # resolve, so there is no project env to re-read before the send.
