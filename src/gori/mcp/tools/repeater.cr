      # The request bytes to PERSIST: the author's own, verbatim.
      #
      # These used to be `Env.mask_secrets(request).to_slice`, and that is a draft-time
      # transform applied to the operator's authored test case — the P7 line. `mask_secrets`
      # resolves against `Env.masking_vars`, which folds in `Bindings#held_values`, so an
      # agent that typed a LIVE token had gori rewrite it to `$CTOK` **in the stored row**.
      # No other writer does this: the TUI persists what the operator typed
      # (`RepeaterController#save_current_repeater`) and so does `gori run repeater`.
      #
      # It was not merely surprising, it SPLIT the surfaces. `flow_id` survives an
      # `update_repeater` that replaces every byte, and the TUI turns `flow_id` into
      # `RepeaterView#evidence?` — which by design does NOT expand `$NAME` (a capture's
      # `$filter` is a byte the origin saw, not a reference anybody wrote). So one stored row
      # put `Authorization: Bearer $CTOK` on the wire from the TUI and the real token from
      # MCP and the CLI, under `✓ sent → 200` on all three.
      #
      # Redaction is kept where it belongs: on the way OUT. Every field this tool returns to
      # the LLM (`summary`, `target`, `name`) is still derived from a masked copy, exactly as
      # `send_request`'s reply already separates `wire` from its masked display. What changes
      # is that a value the AUTHOR put in a request draft is stored the way they wrote it —
      # the same standing as an operator typing it into the TUI editor, and the same standing
      # `flows` already gives it for captured traffic. `bindings.cr`'s redaction guarantee
      # names this exception alongside the capture one.

      # A repeater field that REACHES THE WIRE, to PERSIST: the author's own, verbatim.
      #
      # `target` and `sni` used to go through `Env.mask_secrets` on the way in, justified as
      # "short author-typed fields with no wire semantics of their own … re-expanded
      # identically by every surface". Half of that is true and the half that is not destroys
      # the value:
      #
      #   * **They have wire semantics.** `sni` IS the TLS `server_name` extension — the field
      #     a vhost-confusion, certificate-routing or CDN-origin test exists to control — and
      #     `target` is the dial tuple, which also supplies the ClientHello ServerName whenever
      #     `sni` is absent. Neither is a label.
      #   * **The two ends do not share a vocabulary.** Masking resolves against
      #     `Env.masking_vars`, which folds in every session-binding value currently held
      #     (including disabled rules); the send path resolves with `Env.effective_vars` — env
      #     vars only — and `Repeater::Plan` additionally runs
      #     `refuse_unresolved(Env.unresolved(s, deferred: nil))`, which refuses a declared
      #     binding name outright. So a binding value masked into an SNI mints a `$NAME` that
      #     can never resolve on any send path, from any surface. A one-way door.
      #
      # An author who typed `prod-edge-07.internal.example.com` while a rule bound `$edge` to
      # `prod-edge-07` got `$edge.internal.example.com` in the row, every send refused, the
      # original string unrecoverable, and a prescription ("set the env var") that would put a
      # GUESSED hostname in the ClientHello of a vhost test. `update_repeater` re-reads and
      # re-masks a field the caller never mentioned, so a plain RENAME destroyed an SNI the
      # CLI had stored correctly.
      #
      # Same seam, same reason and same resolution as `stored_request` (round 5) and the
      # WebSocket-frame store (round 6): a store row is a claim that those exact bytes are the
      # author's. Redaction stays on the way OUT — `masked_target` still feeds every field

      #   * `resync_truncated_head` — a capture cut at CAPTURE_MAX keeps its original
      #     `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` over a body with no terminating 0-chunk (or a
      #     Content-Length promising bytes that no longer exist), so the send blocked for
      #     the full 30 s io_timeout and put a partial chunked stream on the wire. That
      #     function's stated reason for existing is "so the repeater terminates instead
      #     of hanging"; this was the one caller that did not get it.
      #   * `origin_form_bytes` — every plain-HTTP flow gori captures has an ABSOLUTE-form
      #     request line (that is how a proxy client writes it), which was then sent
      #     verbatim to an origin that expects origin-form.
      #   * `build_target` — this was a third hand-rolled copy of the authority formula,
      #     without the ws/wss default-port fold or IPv6 re-bracketing the shared one has.
      #
      # `origin_form_bytes` is also the one of the three that is not always housekeeping:
      # on a flow gori recorded from a DIRECT send the absolute-form line is the routing /
      # cache-poisoning / SSRF payload, and baking the rewrite in here made the loss
