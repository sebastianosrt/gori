      # An agent that confirms a finding can leave behind more than prose: the ordered list of
      # Repeater sends that demonstrates it, each with a role and the one result it expects.
      # `run_retest` then answers the question a fix needs answered — "is it still there" —
      # with a verdict rather than a transcript, and the run is kept on the Issue so the next
      # agent (or the next week) can see what it said last time.
      #
      # `list_retest_steps` resolves each step against the project as it is NOW, so the reply

      # caller must be able to decide whether to pass `confirm` WITHOUT sending anything
      # first.
