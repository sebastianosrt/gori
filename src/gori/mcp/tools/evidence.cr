      # Repeater re-send and History retention. An agent that confirms a finding and then
      # retests the fix is exactly the workflow the copy exists for: freeze the response that
      # proved it, send again, freeze that too, and the issue holds both.
      #
      # `freeze_evidence` is the write; `list_evidence` / `get_evidence` read what
      # `get_issue` only summarises (provenance and hashes); link/unlink only change Issue
      # membership; `delete_evidence` is the copy's only way out. Bytes come back the way
      # `get_flow` returns them — heads redacted unless `include_sensitive`, bodies decoded
      # and capped — never through the activity feed.
