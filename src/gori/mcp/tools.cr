      #                     did run keep their History rows (P7: record the wire).
      #   timing_requests   yes — `Repeater::Timing.run` polls it between pairs; up to
      #                     MAX_ITERATIONS pairs of real requests to the target.
      #   cookie_crack      NO. It is pure CPU over a wordlist with no outbound and no yield
      #                     point, so the reader fiber never runs during it and the

      #   send_request /    yes — the one-shot send engines close their owned socket when the
      #   send_websocket    predicate fires, so a silent origin cannot pin the serial worker.
