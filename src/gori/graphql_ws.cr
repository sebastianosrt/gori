module Gori
  # GraphQL carried over a WebSocket — how every real GraphQL SUBSCRIPTION runs.
  #
  # The document does not travel in a request body here; it travels inside a frame, wrapped in
  # the subprotocol's own envelope:
  #
  #   graphql-transport-ws  {"id":"1","type":"subscribe","payload":{"query":"subscription …"}}
  #   subscriptions-transport-ws (legacy Apollo)   {"id":"1","type":"start","payload":{…}}
  #
  # Every decode pane gori has is keyed on a request or response BODY, and a 101 flow has
  # neither — its bytes live in the `ws_messages` table. So a subscription showed up as raw
  # JSON, one line per frame, with no GRAPHQL pane offered: the same "gori did not notice this
  # is GraphQL" the HTTP side had, one transport over.
  #
  # ## What counts as an operation
  #
  # NOT the `type` name. The two subprotocols spell the same frame `subscribe` and `start`, a
  # third might spell it something else again, and gori has no reason to hold a table of
  # protocol versions to answer a question the payload answers by itself: a frame carries an
  # operation when its `payload` parses as a GraphQL envelope. That is the same
  # selection-set-bearing `"query"` test `Gori::Graphql` applies everywhere else — the one
  # detector — so `{"type":"ping"}`, `{"type":"next","payload":{"data":…}}` (a RESULT, not a
  # document) and an unrelated JSON protocol all correctly carry nothing.
  #
  # A bare envelope sent with no wrapper (`{"query":"{ me }"}`, which some servers accept over
  # a socket) is recognised too, with a nil `type`.

    # a persisted query (`persistedQuery` — its `Query` matches case-insensitively). A frame
    # without it cannot be an operation, so the byte scan below skips its `JSON.parse` — which
    # matters because this runs on the WHOLE transcript, every refresh poll, for an open 101
    # detail (a busy socket's frame log grows without bound). `next`/`data` result frames,
    # `ping`, `connection_ack` and an unrelated JSON protocol all lack it and cost only the scan.
