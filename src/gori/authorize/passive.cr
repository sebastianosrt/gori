      # AGAIN, once per identity, and passive is unattended — the operator never gets to decide

      # `:no_effect` is the interesting one, and it replaced a "does the request carry a Cookie
      # or Authorization header?" test. That heuristic asked the wrong question twice over: it
      # missed APIs authenticating through `X-Api-Key` and friends, and on a site the operator
      # was not logged into it skipped everything while saying nothing.
      #
      # The exact question is whether any identity would CHANGE this request. If none does,
      # every trial sends identical bytes, the responses match by construction, and the row
      # reads `⚠ same` — a finding manufactured out of nothing. That is worse than skipping:
      # a public site would light up red on every page. Asking it this way also fixes itself
      # the moment the operator adds an identity that sets a session.

      # Passive replay is a lens on WHAT THE BROWSER TOUCHED, and a request the operator (or an
      # agent beside them) just made by hand is not that: replaying it says nothing they did not
      # already ask for, and it fans one keystroke out into a shadow request per identity. It is
      # also the marker that keeps this feature from feeding itself, now that the Repeater
      # records by default — `AuthorizeController`'s watcher comment used to say a self-loop was
      # impossible "because nothing writes them back with `insert_flow`", and that stopped being
      # true. Only `passive_skip_reason` consults it; a human who names a flow gets it replayed.
      #
      # An IMPORTED flow is deliberately not caught: gori never sent it, it describes a real
      # endpoint somebody captured, and replaying it is exactly what an operator handed a HAR
      # wants. `FlowSource::Kind#sent_by_gori?` draws that line once.
      #
      # A row whose provenance predates the column answers FALSE — it is replayed as before.
      # Those are overwhelmingly proxy captures (nothing else recorded by default when they were
      # written), and treating "not recorded" as "gori's own" would silently switch passive
      # replay off for every project captured with an older gori.

      # Lifting that rung must NOT lift what comes after it. `skip_reason` is an ORDERED chain

      # fourth — `:no_effect` — and replay a flow no identity changes. Every trial then sends
      # byte-identical bytes, every verdict comes back `Same`, and the run reports a bypass it
