module Gori::Authorize
  # Why one option set cannot become a runnable authorize run.
  #
  # The builder never writes the user-facing sentence: every surface phrases these in its
  # own idiom (`gori run authorize: name a flow id or --query` vs the TUI's `Send to
  # Authorize from History to begin`), and those strings are part of each surface's
  # contract. So `reason` is the machine-readable fact and the `message` here is only a
  # fallback for a caller that has nothing better to say.
  #
  # EVERY MEMBER ADDED HERE OBLIGATES AN ARM IN `gori run authorize` AND ONE IN THE MCP
  # `authorize_*` TOOLS — both switch on this exhaustively (`case … in`), so a new member is
  # a compile error until each has an answer and a next thing to type. (The TUI tab does not
  # appear here: its queue is live view state rather than an options set, so it makes the same
  # refusals against the view — see `AuthorizeController#comparable_batch`.) Keep the set as
  # small as the real failure modes require.
  class PlanError < Exception
    enum Reason
      # No selection at all: neither a flow id nor a query. (A usage mistake, not an empty
      # result — see `NoFlows`.)
      NoTarget
      # A selection was given and resolved to zero flows: unknown/pruned ids, or a query
      # that matched nothing. `detail` = the query, when one was the selector.
      NoFlows
      # The QL query compiled to no clause at all (a bad field / numeric / regex), or the
      # search itself failed. The empty filter matches EVERY flow, so running it would
      # replay the whole history — the opposite of what was asked. `detail` = the query,
      # or the underlying error for a failed search.
      BadQuery
      # The resolved identity set cannot produce a comparison: fewer than two identities
      # once the as-captured baseline is in place, so every trial would be the baseline
      # judged against itself and the run would report `no identity matched the baseline`
      # about a test that compared nothing. `detail` = where the set came from ("json" /
      # "project"), for a surface that wants to name the file or the tab to fix.
      NoIdentities
      # Two identities in the resolved set share a name (case-insensitively). Refused rather
      # than run, because the name is the ONLY thing that tells the rows of the results table
      # apart: two "admin" rows leave no way to say which session produced which verdict, and
      # `bypasses[].identities` names a string a caller then cannot resolve back to a slot.
      # The TUI's identity form has always refused it; this is the same rule for a `--identities`
      # file, an MCP `identities` array, and a hand-edited settings row. `detail` = the name.
      DuplicateIdentity
      # Two or more identities in the resolved set carry `baseline: true`. Refused rather than
      # run, and refused rather than silently resolved: the baseline is the ONE response every
      # other row is judged against, and a set with two of them does not say which. Running it
      # anyway compared nothing — both rows came back `baseline`, no row was left to compare,
      # and the surfaces disagreed about the word for that (MCP said `enforced`). The MCP
      # schema has always promised "Exactly one may carry baseline:true"; this enforces it for
      # `--identities`, an MCP `identities` array and a hand-edited settings blob alike.
      # `detail` = the names, in order.
      MultipleBaselines
      # Flows were selected, and every one of them was skipped — unsafe method, incomplete,
      # answered by gori, no identity changes it, out of scope, duplicate. `detail` = the
      # per-reason tally; `PlanError#skipped` carries the full per-flow list, because "a run
      # that sends nothing says so" (DESIGN.md §7, 2026-07-26) and a bare count cannot.
