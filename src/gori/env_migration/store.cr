    # A PROJECT DATABASE reconciled with this install's token grammar, the first time the project
    # is opened after the grammar moved.
    #
    # Namespaced is the grammar for everyone, so an existing project is full of bare `$KEY` drafts,
    # rule replacements and slot headers that the new reader would hand to the wire as literal
    # text. Nothing asks the operator: the project says which grammar its own bytes are spelled in
    # (the MARKER below), the install says which one it reads, and when the two disagree gori
    # re-spells the rows and says what it did.
    #
    # The COLUMN LIST is the interesting part, and it is a judgement about each column rather than
    # a sweep:
    #
    #   * REWRITTEN — bytes an operator authored that a send seam expands: a draft Repeater's
    #     request/target/sni/name, its WS messages, a Fuzzer template, a Miner and a Sequencer
    #     request, a rewrite rule's `replacement`, a session slot's header values, and the display
    #     text `Env.mask_secrets` writes a token into (issue titles and notes, note bodies).
    #   * SKIPPED — every EVIDENCE row (`flow_id` not null). A capture expands nothing
    #     (`Repeater::PlanOptions#evidence?`), so its `$filter` is a byte the origin sent;
    #     re-spelling it would edit a capture to no effect on the wire and every effect on the
    #     record.
    #   * LEFT ALONE, deliberately — project and global env var NAMES (they are table keys, not
    #     tokens) and their VALUES (nothing re-expands a var's value), extract-rule names (the
    #     same), a rule's `pattern` (a regex/needle, never expanded), a Fuzzer's payload sets
    #     (`config`, never expanded), `fuzz_results`/`issue_evidence`/`flows` (sent bytes —
    #     evidence), QL views, scope rules, colormarkers and probe rules (no token seam at all).

    # The per-project marker: WHICH grammar the tokens in this database are spelled in. Lives in
    # the project's own settings KV, next to `env.vars` (`Env::PROJECT_VARS_KEY`) — the same table
    # the project's env vars, slots and views use, so it travels with the database it describes and
    # never with the install.
    #
    # ABSENT means bare, and that is the whole upgrade path: every database written before
    # namespaces existed carries no marker, which is exactly true of its bytes.

    # The grammar `store`'s tokens are spelled in. An unreadable value is treated as the ABSENT
    # value rather than guessed at, because bare is the answer that cannot lose data: re-spelling
