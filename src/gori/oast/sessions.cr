  # PERSISTED listening sessions: list them, re-arm one, release one.
  #
  # A registration outlives the process that minted it — that is the whole point of the
  # `oast_sessions` table (the stored payload that only fires on a nightly job, the
  # back-office browser that opens the mail tomorrow). The TUI had the only implementation
  # of "get that session back", inside `Tui::OastController`, so `gori run oast` and the MCP
  # `oast_*` tools could register and die but never resume. This module is the surface-free
  # half of that controller: the store round trip, the provider re-resolution, and the
  # record → `Session` rebuild, so all three surfaces list, resume and release the SAME rows
  # (DESIGN.md §2 — three surfaces, one engine).
  #
  # NOT required from `oast.cr`'s umbrella, for the same reason `provider_config.cr` is not:
  # that engine is deliberately Store-free, and this file pulls Store in. Its consumers
  # require it directly.
  #
  # Nothing here auto-resumes. Resuming is an operator decision on every surface (P4): a
  # process that opened a project must not start polling a third-party interaction server
  # because a row exists.

    # BY IDENTITY first. A project provider is `provider_id`; a global one is `provider_key`
    # (schema V29, #1192). Before V29 a global provider's session recorded nothing, and was
    # re-resolved by kind + endpoint to the FIRST match: two global providers on one endpoint
    # with different tokens, and the session the second one minted polled with the first one's
    # credential.
    #
    # The row id alone is NOT an identity. `oast_providers.id` is a plain `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY`
    # with no AUTOINCREMENT, so SQLite hands a deleted row's id to the next insert — delete the
    # second interactsh provider and add a webhook.site one, and the sessions that pointed at
    # the first now resolve to the second. `bind` takes the HOST from the session and the TOKEN
    # from the config, so that mismatch does not merely mislabel a row: it puts a webhook.site
    # api key in an `Authorization:` header aimed at an interactsh host the operator never
    # meant to hand it to. Accept an id ONLY when the kind agrees. A global key is a random hex
    # id that is never reused, but it gets the same kind check for the same reason.
    #
    # BY RE-RESOLUTION otherwise: a row from before V29, or one whose provider is gone. Falling
    # through when the provider is simply GONE matters for its own reason: deleting a provider
    # and re-adding the same one used to strand every session it minted with a provider_key of
    # nil, which the TUI reads as "not resumable" forever. `Store#delete_oast_provider` NULLs
    # `provider_id`, and a re-added global provider has a new id, so both land here. Among the
    # providers of the same kind and endpoint:
    #
    #   - one that holds the token the session registered with wins. It is the credential the
    #     session was minted under, so binding it can never swap one account for another.
    #   - failing that, a LONE match is taken: it is the rotated or re-added provider, and the
    #     TOKEN prefers the config because a rotated credential is the live one.
    #   - several, none with that token, is `Ambiguous`. `bind` then polls with the row's own
    #     token and the TUI refuses to file the session under one of them.
    #
    # A session registered with NO saved provider (`provider_key` "") is only ever matched by
