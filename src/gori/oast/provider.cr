module Gori::Oast
  # An OAST backend, bound to one configured endpoint (host + optional token). Five calls:
  #   register        — mint server-side state, return a fresh Session (once, at "listen").
  #   resume          — revive the server state of a Session restored from the store.
  #   generate_payload — LOCAL, no network: a fresh unique payload URL from a Session.
  #   poll            — fetch + normalize new interactions.
  #   deregister      — best-effort release of server state (never raises).
  #
  # generate_payload staying local is a load-bearing invariant: it lets the TUI mint a
  # payload to insert into a Repeater/Fuzzer request on the main fiber without a socket.

    # New interactions, OLDEST FIRST. The order is part of the contract, not an accident of
    # each server's API: every consumer treats a poll's result as chronological — the TUI
    # appends to a list it renders reversed, the store's rowid order IS the display order after
    # a reload, and `gori run oast` prints them as they come. A provider whose API answers
    # newest-first (webhook.site, which must ask for that page to see recent hits at all) flips
    # its batch back here rather than making three surfaces sort.
    #
    # A poll that CANNOT be answered raises. "Nothing came back" and "the server refused us"
    # are the two states an out-of-band listener must never conflate: a rotated token, an
    # expired webhook token or a rate limit would otherwise read exactly like a quiet target,
    # for as long as the operator left it running.
    abstract def poll(http : Http, session : Session) : Array(Interaction)

    # Re-arm a Session rebuilt from the store so its ALREADY-PLANTED payloads keep resolving.
    # This is what makes a delayed callback — the stored payload that only fires on a nightly
    # job, the back-office browser that opens the mail tomorrow — reachable at all: without it
    # a restart could only `register` a NEW correlation id, and every payload minted before it
    # was dead the moment the process exited.
    #
    # Default no-op, which is the honest answer for four of the five backends: webhook.site,
    # postbin, BOAST and custom-http keep (or never had) their state independently of us, so
    # polling the persisted correlation id is the whole of resuming. interactsh overrides —
    # ITS server drops a session on deregister or restart. Unlike `deregister`, this one MAY
    # raise: the operator asked for the session back, and a resume that quietly failed would
    # leave a listener that polls a correlation id the server has never heard of.
    def resume(http : Http, session : Session) : Nil
    end

    # Best-effort teardown. Default no-op; override where the server supports it. MUST NOT
    # raise (callers deregister during cleanup where an error is noise).
    #
    # A no-op here is not "the teardown succeeded" — it is "this build cannot tear this one
    # down", and `deregisters?` below is what tells the two apart. `Sessions.release` used to
    # read a silent return as success and answer `true`, so `gori run oast release` reported a
    # teardown that never left the process for four of the five backends.

    # added without a teardown is honestly reported as one rather than inheriting a silent
    # success. Overridden true by the three that have a real delete API: interactsh
    # (`POST /deregister`), webhook.site (`DELETE /token/{uuid}`), postbin
    # (`DELETE /api/bin/{binId}`).
    #
    # BOAST is the one backend that registers server-side state and offers NO way to release
    # it: go-boast derives the id from the secret and keeps serving it. `release` says so
    # instead of pretending, because the operator's next move — rotate the BOAST secret, or
    # leave the engagement's listener collecting — depends entirely on knowing.

    #
    # CustomHttp is "bring your own OAST server": its register mints a local correlation id and
    # never dials anything, so there is nothing on any server to release and a `release` that
    # refused would be as wrong as one that claimed a teardown. It is the only member of the
    # third state, and it exists so the two honest answers ("released" / "cannot be released")
    # stay honest.

    # walked away (the probe out-of-band bridge) can later tie an arriving callback back to
    # the exact request it came from, without knowing which provider minted it.
    #
    # `correlation_id` is NOT enough: it is per-SESSION, so every payload from one listener
    # shares it and any callback would match every outstanding probe. Four of the five
    # providers append their nonce as the last path segment or the first host label, which is
    # what this default reads; CustomHttp puts it in a query parameter and overrides.

    # Lower-cased because the wire is case-insensitive on both sides that carry it: DNS labels
