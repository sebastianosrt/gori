  # Reachability preflight for the built-in public providers (#1020).
  #
  # Registration talks to a third-party server over HTTPS, so it can fail four ways that look
  # identical from a single failed `oast listen`: the name does not resolve, the port is
  # filtered, the certificate chain is rejected by this machine's trust store, or the provider
  # is simply down. Which one it is decides the remedy — a resolver, a firewall rule, an
  # SSL_CERT_FILE bundle, or another preset — so the operator needs the STAGE, not a verdict.
  #
  # The probe is deliberately the preset host's origin root, not its API: this answers "can
  # this machine complete an HTTPS exchange with that host", and any HTTP status is a yes.
  # Asking `/register` instead would mint third-party state as a side effect of a diagnostic.
  module Preflight
    # `ok` and `stage` are two facts, not one: a reachable preset carries the status it
    # answered with, and a failed one carries the stage plus the layer's own sentence — the
    # same text `oast listen` would have printed, so the two surfaces never disagree.
