    # inherit: `Sessions.release` reads this as "nothing to release" and reports a clean
    # teardown, where a provider that DID register and cannot tear down (BOAST) is reported as
    # not released. The operator's own endpoint keeps logging either way, which is theirs to

    #
    # The fragment is cut FIRST, exactly as `Provider#payload_token` does: a `#` is never on
    # the wire (RFC 3986 §3.5 — the client strips it before sending), so a token carrying one
    # is a token no callback can ever contain, and this override is the only one that reads a
    # value from the END of the URL where a fragment can sit.
