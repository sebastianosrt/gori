  # The outbound-HTTP seam every provider talks through. Abstracting it lets specs drive
  # register/poll with a scripted fake (no sockets) while production dials real servers.
  # OAST talks to THIRD-PARTY interaction servers outside the active-testing scope gate. The
  # production client follows configured upstream routing but skips target host overrides —
  # the same stance as the self-updater.
  # A failure PAST the dial: the connection was established, and then the transfer broke — a
  # reset, a truncated response, a silent peer, a body over the cap. Its own class because the
  # remedy is neither of the dial's: a CA bundle and a resolver are both wrong for a socket that
  # was already open, and so is "check your token" for a server that never answered (#1020).
  # `HttpTransport::Error` is the dial's half of the same split.
