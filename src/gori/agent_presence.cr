module Gori
  # "A process is attached to this PROJECT" — a per-process marker file in a directory beside
  # the database, held for the session's lifetime with an EXCLUSIVE flock.
  #
  # Two kinds, one directory each. `gori mcp` announces an `mcp` marker under
  # `<canonical db_path>.agents/` while it has a store bound, and the TUI and the project
  # picker read that directory to show who is attached (#815). A gori TUI announces a `tui`
  # marker under `<canonical db_path>.windows/` for the length of one project visit, and
  # `get_current_context` reads THAT to tell an agent whether the selection it is relaying
  # belongs to a window still on screen (#1091).
  #
  # The same split as `CaptureLock` + `CaptureStatus`, collapsed into one file per holder:
  # the FLOCK is the truth about liveness (the kernel releases it when the process dies, even
  # on SIGKILL, where an `ensure`-based cleanup never runs), and the JSON body is decoration —
  # the client's name, its pid, when it attached. A marker whose lock nobody holds is a stale
  # leftover, and `live` sweeps it. A marker whose body cannot be parsed is still a live
  # attachment ("someone is here, name unknown"), because the lock says so.
  #
  # WHY NOT `OpenLock`: that lock is anonymous and shared — it answers "somebody has this
  # database open", and a second TUI, a `gori run` read, or a delete's dry-run count all hold
  # it too, so it can neither name the holder nor tell an agent from anything else. WHY NOT A
  # DB ROW: the picker never opens project databases (it stats files), a `--read-only` MCP
  # server cannot write one, and a heartbeat write would move `data_version` and make every
  # watching TUI reload rules/scope/bindings on each beat.
  #
  # Keyed on the CANONICALIZED db path (`Paths.canonical_file`, `OpenLock.path`'s rule) so a
  # `--db` spelling difference or a symlinked `$GORI_HOME` cannot give one database two marker
  # directories. Best effort throughout: announcing can fail (an unwritable `--db` parent, a
  # filesystem without flock) and the server must run anyway, so every failure degrades to
  # "no marker" with one warning line — never a raise.
  class AgentPresence
    # One directory PER KIND, and that split is load-bearing rather than tidiness (#1091).
    # `count` must stay parse-free for the project picker's render path, so a reader can only
    # tell an agent from a TUI window by WHERE its marker is; `parse_entry` falls back to the
    # directory's kind when a body will not parse, which a body-carried kind could not do; and
    # `Tools` announces its own `mcp` marker the moment it binds, so a reader that forgot to
    # filter would find this process and call it a live TUI forever. A directory makes all
    # three impossible instead of merely unlikely.
