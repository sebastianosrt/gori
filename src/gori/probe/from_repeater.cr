    # Does this flow plausibly HOLD a WebSocket transcript — i.e. is it worth reading
    # `ws_messages` for? The gate in front of every WS rescan, and it is deliberately WIDER
    # than `Store::FlowDetail#websocket?`.
    #
    # `websocket?` answers "did this flow OPEN a socket", which it settles from the HANDSHAKE:
    # for h1 it requires the stored REQUEST head to carry `Upgrade: websocket`, for h2 an
    # extended CONNECT marker. That is the right question for HAR export and for refusing a
    # one-shot replay. It is the wrong one here, because rows can exist without a handshake
    # that proves them: `Import::Har.ws_messages` has no status or header gate at all — its
    # comment says outright that "every reader asks the ROWS" — so a foreign HAR whose entry
    # carries `_webSocketMessages` beside a request head with the `Upgrade:` line stripped
    # (Chrome's provisional headers) lands real frames on a flow `websocket?` calls false.
    # Gating the scanner on it alone traded the h2 blind spot for an imported-capture one:
    # History's MESSAGES pane still showed the transcript while the probe reported nothing.
    #
    # So: either transport's handshake, OR a bare 101 — the predicate the scanner used before
    # it learned about h2, kept so this only ever WIDENS. Everything it lets through costs one
    # `ws_messages_after` query that returns nothing; nothing it lets through can produce a
    # finding that is not in the rows.

    #
    # It carries each frame's REAL opcode and drops ONLY control frames. That is the whole
    # reason this is a named function rather than a `map` at the call site: the TUI's copy
    # filtered to `opcode == 1` and stamped every row it kept as text, so a BINARY frame never
    # reached `Passive::WsPayloads` — which scans binary frames deliberately (protobuf/msgpack/
    # CBOR is the mainstream realtime encoding, and a credential rides in one as an ordinary
    # ASCII string field). A secret in a binary frame was therefore reported for a socket gori
    # watched and missed for the same socket replayed by hand. Control frames (ping/pong/close)
    # carry no application payload, which is why the rule skips them anyway.

      #     (`record.request` can carry invalid UTF-8: the repeater editor seeds from a
      #     captured request head+body without scrubbing) and `Http1.parse_headers` reads
      #     CRLF only. Cf. secret_in_url.cr / issues_export.one_line.
      #   * the BODY is taken VERBATIM. This file used to say the detail was for "PASSIVE
      #     ANALYSIS only (never re-sent), so scrub is lossless here" — and that is false:
      #     `Scan.scan_repeaters` hands it to `Active.analyze`, which puts `plan.request` on
      #     the wire. Scrubbing turned a binary/protobuf/multipart body's `00 ff 41 fe` into
      #     `00 ef bf bd 41 ef bf bd`, so the probe measured a request the operator never
      #     authored — differential rules compared against a differently-framed baseline, and
      #     corrupted bytes reached the origin.
      #
      # `Env.head_body_separator` takes whichever blank-line boundary occurs FIRST — the
      # editor uses bare-LF, so a literal "\r\n\r\n" inside the body must not win over the
