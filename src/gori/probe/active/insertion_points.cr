    module Active
      # The shared INSERTION-POINT model for the active value-injection rules. Before this, each
      # rule (reflected_param, ssti, error_based_sqli, backslash_powered, lfi_param_traversal)
      # re-implemented the same query parsing, value mutation, request rebuild, and dedup-key
      # construction — and most only ever touched query parameters. This module owns that logic
      # once, across query / form / JSON / header / cookie, so a rule declares WHICH locations it
      # cares about and WHAT it does to a value, and nothing else.
      #
      # Two design constraints shape every method here:
      #   * PURITY / equivalence. `enumerate` is a pure function of (detail, opts, locations); a
      #     rule feeds the SAME enumeration into both `dedup_key` and `plan`, so the analyzer's
      #     cheap pre-plan dedup key can never drift from the built plan's (the per-rule
      #     equivalence spec). `enumerate` therefore applies only STRUCTURAL/location gates — the
      #     method gate and the per-rule param cap stay in the rule, applied identically on both
      #     paths.
      #   * BYTE PRESERVATION. Captured bytes may be invalid UTF-8, and a probe must re-send an
      #     operator's untouched fields verbatim (never as U+FFFD). So query/form parsing slices on
      #     byte offsets found by scanning (never scrubs what is re-sent), JSON splices the injected
      #     values into the captured bytes (`JsonSpans`), and header/cookie walking is byte-safe. The
      #     ONE decoded value a rule inspects (`Slot#value`) is exposed UNSCRUBBED; a rule that runs
      #     a PCRE over it scrubs at the point of use (only lfi does).
      module InsertionPoints
        # One injectable EXISTING value in a captured request. `index`/`raw_name`/`raw_value` are
        # the addressing + on-wire bytes `build` needs to splice a new value back and leave every
        # other byte untouched; `name`/`value` are the decoded views a rule reads.
        #
        #   loc       — the insertion surface (query/form/json/headers/cookies).
        #   index     — position in that surface's ORDERED member list: the index into the FULL
        #               `split('&')` list for query/form (so non-slot pairs pass through verbatim)
        #               and the head-line index for headers; -1 for json/cookies, which `build`
        #               re-addresses by `name` (JSON top-level key / cookie crumb name).
        #   name      — DECODED name. Becomes `Param.name` and the dedup token. UNSCRUBBED.
        #   raw_name  — on-wire name, spliced back verbatim.
        #   value     — DECODED current value. UNSCRUBBED — inspection/gating only, never re-sent.
        #   raw_value — on-wire value substring, for byte-preserving RAW prefix/suffix.
