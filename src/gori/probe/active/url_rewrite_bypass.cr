      # Active access-control bypass probe via URL-REWRITE headers (`X-Original-URL` / `X-Rewrite-URL`).
      # Some app frameworks (classic ASP.NET, some Symfony/PHP setups) let a request to an ALLOWED path
      # (`/`) be internally re-routed to another path named in these headers — while the edge proxy
      # enforces its ACL on the literal request line (`/`). So `GET /` + `X-Original-URL: /admin` can
      # serve `/admin` past a proxy that would have blocked `GET /admin`. These path-rewrite headers
      # were DELIBERATELY excluded from ForbiddenBypass (which forges a single flat client-IP value);
      # this is their dedicated probe.
      #
      # For one in-scope flow whose captured response was 401/403/404, it sends THREE requests:
      #   probe    = `GET /` + X-Original-URL/X-Rewrite-URL naming the original (gated) path
      #   control  = plain `GET /` (no rewrite headers)
      #   control2 = plain `GET /` again
      # and flags Medium "possible bypass" when the probe is 2xx AND its {status, body-size}
      # fingerprint differs from the control's. `GET /` usually 200s regardless, so a bare "probe
      # 200" is meaningless — only a probe response that DIFFERS from the plain-root control shows
      # the rewrite header actually selected the gated resource.
      #
      # The SECOND control is what makes that difference trustworthy. With one control, any root
      # page whose body length moves between two requests — a CSRF token of varying length, a
      # timestamp, a rotating ad slot, a served-in-N-ms footer — read as "differs from the control"
      # and fired a bypass finding on EVERY 401/403/404 path on the site. Sending the plain root
      # twice measures that jitter directly: if the two controls disagree, the root is not stable
      # enough for a size comparison to mean anything and the rule declines to report rather than
      # guess. A stable root costs nothing and behaves exactly as before.
      #
      # Still Medium/"possible": the fingerprint is coarse, so a gated page that happens to match
      # the root's status AND length is a miss. Gated to body-comparable methods (GET by default,
      # HEAD out; Options#allow_unsafe widens).
