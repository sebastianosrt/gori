      # Active NGINX alias-traversal probe. A classic NGINX misconfiguration serves a static
      # directory with an off-by-one `location` prefix:
      #
      #     location /static { alias /var/www/app/static/; }   # NOTE: no trailing slash on `location`
      #
      # Because the `location` prefix lacks a trailing slash, a URI like `/static../` is still a
      # prefix match and resolves to `/var/www/app/static/../` — one directory ABOVE the alias
      # root — letting an attacker read files outside the intended tree (Orange Tsai, BlackHat
      # USA 2018; PortSwigger BApp "NGINX Alias Traversal").
      #
      # For one in-scope flow whose captured response was a successful (2xx) NON-HTML asset, this
      # re-fetches THE SAME resource through the alias boundary: `/static/main.css` is re-requested
      # as `/static../static/main.css`. On a correctly-configured server that path 404s — the `..`
      # is part of a literal segment `static..`, not a collapsed `../`, so no `location` matches and
      # nothing is served. On the vulnerable config it resolves right back to the very same file and
      # returns byte-identical content. That byte-for-byte match against the CAPTURED baseline is
      # the confirmation, so a normal 404/redirect/different-page can't produce a false positive.
      #
      # Gated hard to stay quiet and low-FP:
      #   * GET by default — the confirmation compares response BODIES, and HEAD returns none (a
      #     safe, idempotent re-read of a resource the browser already fetched). An explicit opt-in
      #     (Options#allow_unsafe: manual per-flow scan / AGGRESSIVE) widens to other body-bearing
      #     methods; HEAD stays out regardless.
      #   * 2xx captured status — there must be a real served resource to re-fetch.
      #   * Non-HTML content type — a SPA / framework catch-all returns the SAME index.html for
      #     ANY path, so an HTML baseline could byte-match the traversal path WITHOUT any alias
      #     bug. Alias directives serve static file trees (css/js/images/fonts/…) anyway, so
      #     restricting to non-HTML kills that dominant false positive at negligible coverage cost.
      #   * A path shaped `/<seg>/<more>` — we need a leading location segment to fold `..` after,
      #     plus a real resource under it to re-fetch.
      #
      # The fold has to land on the `location` prefix EXACTLY, so which prefix a config used
      # decides which probe finds it — and a one-segment guess only ever tested `location /assets`.
      # `location /assets/js`, `location /media/uploads`, `location /files/docs` are just as
      # ordinary, and against those the single probe asked a question the server was always going
      # to answer "404" to: not a clean result, a question never asked. So the deeper boundary is
      # probed too, as a FOLLOW-UP request, when the path has a segment to spare
      # (`/assets/js/app.js` → `/assets../assets/js/app.js` AND `/assets/js../assets/js/app.js`).
      # Two boundaries is where it stops: `alias` roots three levels down are rare enough not to
      # be worth a third request on every static asset in a browse, and the confirmation below is
      # per-probe anyway, so an extra leg can only add coverage, never a false positive.
