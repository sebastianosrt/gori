      # Boolean-based blind SQL injection. Where `error_based_sqli` needs the backend to LEAK a
      # verbose parser diagnostic, this rule confirms an injection that produces NO error and NO
      # visible reflection — the classic blind case — by asking the endpoint a pair of questions
      # whose only difference is a SQL truth value.
      #
      # For each param it appends a breakout that keeps the statement valid but forces the injected
      # predicate TRUE (`… AND '1'='1`) and, separately, FALSE (`… AND '1'='2`). If the value is
      # concatenated into a SQL WHERE, the TRUE leg returns the SAME rows as the baseline (the extra
      # always-true clause is a no-op) while the FALSE leg returns a DIFFERENT page (typically empty
      # / "not found"). The tell is that differential BETWEEN the two probe legs — not probe-vs-
      # baseline, which `error_based_sqli` already covers and which a blind injection never trips.
      #
      # The "same page modulo dynamic tokens" question is answered with the 64-bit content SimHash
      # from `discover/fingerprint.cr` — the same tool (and the same `simhash_distance` default of 3)
      # the crawler uses to decide "is this body the soft-404 baseline again?". It ignores pure-
      # numeric / long-hex / uuid tokens, so a timestamp or CSRF field jittering between requests
      # does not move the hash. Two responses are treated as the SAME iff their HTTP status matches
      # AND their SimHashes are within `SIMHASH_DISTANCE` hamming.
      #
      # That distance is also the rule's RECALL boundary, on purpose: it detects the "full vs empty /
      # not-found" shape a blind boolean break usually produces. An injection whose FALSE leg drops
      # only a row or two from a large listing can stay within `SIMHASH_DISTANCE` of the baseline and
      # read as "same" — a missed detection, the safe direction. Tightening the radius to catch it
      # would start reporting ordinary content jitter as an oracle, so the boundary stays where the
      # crawler's calibration put it.
      #
      # Two false-positive guards stack (the shape `backslash_powered` uses):
      #   * a SECOND identical baseline (results[1]) proves the endpoint answers the same request
      #     the same way twice. A self-varying page (an A/B split, a rotating backend, a rate
      #     limiter) whose two baselines already disagree cannot support a difference test, so the
      #     whole flow DECLINES rather than reading its own jitter as a boolean oracle.
      #   * the TRUE leg must match the baseline. That is what suppresses REFLECTION: an endpoint
      #     that echoes the payload renders the `AND '1'='1` text into its body, so the TRUE leg
      #     differs from the baseline and the param is skipped. It also suppresses an INERT param,
      #     whose TRUE and FALSE legs are both unchanged, so the FALSE leg matches the baseline and
      #     the differential is empty. Only "TRUE == baseline AND FALSE != baseline" fires.
      #
      # A confirmed blind injection is a stronger, more directly exploitable result than a single
      # error echo, so this reports Critical — outranking `error_based_sqli`'s High. Insertion
      # points come from the shared `InsertionPoints` model (query/form/json). The differential
      # reads BODIES, so HEAD is always out; by default GET only, widened to body-bearing methods
