      # Active HTTP request-smuggling / desync detector (CL.TE / TE.CL / TE.TE).
      #
      # A smuggling vulnerability exists when a front-end and a back-end DISAGREE on where one
      # request's body ends — because they read the Content-Length / Transfer-Encoding framing
      # differently. gori can already *send* deliberate CL/TE conflicts (Repeater "send group",
      # the codec's own rejection paths); this rule is the AUTOMATED detector that was the ironic
      # gap for a framing-centric tool. It is a pure `Active::Rule`: it crafts its OWN synthetic
      # `POST /` bytes (the captured method/body are irrelevant — only host/port/scheme and the
      # framing environment matter) and the analyzer owns the send.
      #
      # SAFETY POSTURE (user-decided, baked in exactly here):
      #   * TIMING is the DEFAULT signal. Each timing probe is an INCOMPLETE request that makes one
      #     framing tier block waiting for bytes that never arrive. It is SELF-DAMAGING: the origin
      #     abandons it on its own idle timeout and the blast radius is our OWN dedicated socket —
      #     nothing is smuggled into anyone else's request. Timing probes ride `followups` (a FRESH
      #     connection each), so the two repeats of a variant confirm INDEPENDENTLY (a shared socket
      #     could not — the first hang would retire it and the second would read as "skipped").
      #   * The DIFFERENTIAL confirm leg sends a COMPLETE smuggled prefix and reads the poisoned
      #     follow-up on the SAME socket (a `pipeline` group). A complete prefix could, in a shared
      #     back-end pool, affect ANOTHER user, so it runs ONLY under `opts.aggressive &&
      #     opts.allow_unsafe` — never in the default automatic scan.
      #   * DISABLED-BY-DEFAULT in the Rules sub-tab (it sends POST bodies): the rule's id is in
      #     `Probe::DEFAULT_DISABLED_RULES`, so the operator must opt in before it ever runs — which
      #     is what keeps the intrusive differential from auto-firing even in AGGRESSIVE mode.
      #   * `opts.allow_unsafe` is required to build a plan at all (synthetic POST bodies), so an
      #     automatic SAFE-method sweep is a strict no-op regardless of the toggle.
      #
      # VERDICT: High for a timing-only lead (a confirmed desync PRIMITIVE — one tier blocks on an
      # incomplete body the other considered complete — but exploitation is unproven); Critical when
      # the differential confirm fires (a smuggled canary demonstrably poisoned a neighbouring
      # request). Two independent repeats per variant plus a fast, reproducible baseline turn
      # endpoint jitter into a DECLINE rather than a finding (the backslash_powered discipline).
