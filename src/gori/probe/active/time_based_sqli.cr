      # Time-based blind SQL injection. The last blind case `error_based_sqli` (error echo) and
      # `boolean_sqli` (a body differential) cannot reach: an injection that leaks NOTHING into the
      # response — no error, no reflection, no content change — and shows up ONLY in how long the
      # response takes. The rule injects a server-side delay (`SLEEP(n)`, `pg_sleep(n)`,
      # `WAITFOR DELAY`) and confirms it in the measured latency.
      #
      # Confirmation is deliberately NOT "one probe was slow" — a slow endpoint would false-fire on
      # that. For each param it sends TWO baselines (no delay) plus TWO increasing delays and requires
      # the latency to SCALE with the injected delay: the short leg must clear the baseline, the long
      # leg must clear it by more, and the long-minus-short increment must track the requested
      # increment (P6-respecting confirmation, per the issue). A uniformly slow endpoint answers all
      # three in roughly the same time, so the increment is ~0 and nothing fires; only a delay the
      # injection actually controls makes the two legs pull apart.
      #
      # The second baseline is the same stability guard `boolean_sqli` uses: an endpoint whose own
      # nominal latency swings by as much as the signal we look for (the two baselines disagree by
      # ≥ MIN_SHORT_DELTA) cannot support a timing oracle — its jitter alone could satisfy the three
      # thresholds by chance and raise a false Critical — so the flow DECLINES rather than measures
      # noise. The remaining reference is the SLOWER of the two baselines, so a transiently-fast
      # baseline sample cannot inflate the deltas either.
      #
      # P6: this rule DELIBERATELY waits. It never runs on the proxy data path — it rides the active
      # probe worker like every other active rule — but because each confirming leg costs real
      # wall-clock seconds, it ships DEFAULT-OFF (see `Probe::DEFAULT_DISABLED_RULES`), opt-in from
      # the Rules sub-tab (a manual per-flow scan honours the same switch), the same posture as
      # `request_smuggling`. The delays are kept well under the analyzer's per-probe socket
      # timeout (ACTIVE_TIMEOUT, 10 s) so a real sleep returns rather than erroring; a leg that
      # DID error or time out is skipped, not read as a signal.
      #
      # A confirmed injection reports Critical, outranking `error_based_sqli`'s High. The differential
      # reads only LATENCY, but a delay landing requires a body-bearing request, so — like the sibling
      # rules — HEAD is out and by default GET only (widened under `allow_unsafe`). Insertion points
      # come from the shared `InsertionPoints` model.
