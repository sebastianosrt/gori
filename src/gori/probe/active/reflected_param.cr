      # Reflected parameters. For one in-scope flow it replaces each existing parameter value
      # (query / form / JSON) with a distinct canary, sends ONE request, and reports the
      # parameters whose canary echoes back — grading each by whether the echo was ENCODED.
      # Gated to safe methods so an automatic probe never mutates server state.
      #
      # Insertion points come from the shared `InsertionPoints` model (query + form + JSON); the
      # rule keeps its own method gate + param cap + canary-grading. A GET/HEAD rarely carries a
      # body, so the form/JSON surfaces materialize almost only under `allow_unsafe` (which admits
      # body-bearing methods) — the method gate, not a special case, does that.
      #
      # The canary carries a MARKER of the four characters that decide whether a reflection is
      # exploitable: `"`, `'`, `<`, `>`. An alphanumeric canary on its own cannot answer that
      # question — it survives HTML-escaping unchanged, so "the value came back" was reported
      # identically for a raw injection point and for output a template escaped correctly. Since
      # correct escaping is the norm, that made the common case the finding: nearly every
      # reflecting endpoint scored Medium.
      #
      # Reading which marker characters came back VERBATIM, immediately after the canary, splits
      # them apart:
      #   * `<` survived        — tag injection is possible; the classic XSS candidate.
      #   * only `"` / `'`      — an attribute-context break, exploitable only in some sinks.
      #   * none survived       — the value was escaped, stripped, or encoded. Still worth knowing
      #                           as a reflection point, so it is reported at Info rather than
      #                           dropped, but it is not an XSS finding.
      # A partial survival is read in order, so `"'<>` reports `"'` — an escaped `<` stops
      # the run exactly where the server's filter did.
      class ReflectedParam < Rule
        # Appended to every canary. Sent URL-encoded (query/form) or JSON-escaped (body), so the
        # server decodes real characters; what comes back tells us what its output layer did with
        # them. Order matters: `survived` reads this prefix-wise.
