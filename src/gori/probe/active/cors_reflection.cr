      # Active CORS origin-reflection probe. Passive analysis can only judge the origins the
      # browser actually sent; it CANNOT prove a server reflects *arbitrary* origins. This rule
      # sends ONE safe-method request with a synthetic, attacker-controlled `Origin` and reports
      # a High issue only when the server both ECHOES that probe origin AND allows credentials
      # — the definitive, exploitable reflected-origin CORS misconfiguration.
      #
      # Gated hard to keep the scan light and low-FP: only endpoints that demonstrably DO CORS,
      # and only GET/HEAD (no state mutation). A well-behaved allowlist rejects the probe origin,
      # so it is never flagged.
      #
      # "Demonstrably does CORS" is Access-Control-Allow-Origin OR `Vary: Origin`, and the second
      # half is not optional. A server only emits ACAO when the REQUEST carried an Origin, and a
      # browser sends no Origin on a same-origin GET — which is most of what a proxied browse
      # captures for an API. Gating on ACAO alone therefore probed only the endpoints whose
      # capture had already been driven cross-origin, i.e. it mostly re-confirmed CORS that was
      # visible in the capture already, and skipped the reflecting endpoint nobody had happened
      # to drive from another origin. `Vary: Origin` is the standing advertisement of exactly the
      # behaviour this rule tests — the response DEPENDS on Origin — and every framework that
      # does dynamic CORS (rack-cors, django-cors-headers, Spring, Express cors) emits it whether
      # or not an Origin arrived. Widening the gate cannot manufacture a false positive:
      # `detections` still fires only when the PROBE response echoes PROBE_ORIGIN back with
      # credentials, so a gate that opens too eagerly costs one request, not a finding.
