      # Active GraphQL introspection probe. The passive `graphql_introspection` rule can only flag
      # introspection the browser already triggered; this ACTIVELY asks a GraphQL endpoint for its
      # schema, catching servers that leave introspection enabled even though nothing on the page
      # ever queried it. It folds into the SAME `{code, host}` issue as the passive rule (shared
      # code `graphql_introspection`, category INFOLEAK), so an active confirmation upgrades — rather
      # than duplicates — a passive suspicion.
      #
      # DELIBERATE SAFE_METHODS EXCEPTION. The active scan is GET/HEAD-only by default because
      # re-sending a captured POST could replay a mutation. This rule may send a POST anyway — BUT it
      # NEVER replays the captured body: it substitutes a fixed, side-effect-free introspection query
      # (`{__schema{queryType{name}}}`), so the concrete hazard SAFE_METHODS guards against (a real
      # server-side mutation) does not apply. The probe method MIRRORS the captured one — a captured
      # GET graphql endpoint is probed with GET, a captured GraphQL POST with POST — so a POST-only
      # server (the common production shape) is still covered by the automatic scan. This mirrors the
      # sanctioned AGGRESSIVE-mode auto-unsafe override: a reasoned, documented exception, not a
      # blanket one.
      #
      # Gated to keep it quiet and low-FP: only GraphQL endpoints (a `/graphql` path or a captured
      # JSON body carrying a top-level `"query"` GraphQL document — the same predicate as
      # Passive::Tech), and confirmation is the binary `"__schema":{` anchor (a query echo, where
      # `__schema` is unquoted, never matches). A server with introspection disabled answers with an
