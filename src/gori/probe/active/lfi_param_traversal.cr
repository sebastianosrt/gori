      # Active parameter path-traversal / LFI probe (a self-referential byte differential, sibling of
      # NginxAliasTraversal but keyed on a PARAMETER value instead of the URL path). When a
      # parameter names a file the server reads off disk (`?file=doc.pdf`, `?page=home.html`), an
      # un-canonicalized read resolves `..` segments — the local-file-inclusion / path-traversal
      # class. Passive analysis cannot tell such a parameter apart from any other string.
      #
      # For one in-scope flow whose captured response was a 2xx with a body, it re-fetches THE SAME
      # resource through a folded `..` in the parameter value:
      #     file=doc.pdf  ->  file=x/../doc.pdf   (and an encoded  x/%2e%2e/  variant)
      # plus a CONTROL that cannot normalize back:
      #     file=x/zzznope/doc.pdf
      # On a vulnerable server the folded value resolves to the very same file and returns
      # byte-identical content to the captured baseline, while the control (a real, non-existent
      # subdirectory) does NOT. That control is the crucial guard a bare byte-diff on a *value* needs:
      # a catch-all / SPA router that returns the same page for EVERY value would byte-match the fold
      # with no traversal bug — but it also matches the control, so `control != baseline` suppresses it.
      #
      # Non-intrusive: it re-reads a file the browser already fetched (no `/etc/passwd`). Gated hard:
      #   * GET by default (the confirmation compares BODIES → HEAD out); Options#allow_unsafe widens
      #     to other body-bearing methods for a deliberate manual/AGGRESSIVE run.
      #   * 2xx captured status with a non-empty body — there must be a real served resource + baseline.
      #   * a PATH-LIKE parameter (value holds a `/` or a file extension, or a known file-ish name) whose
      #     value does not already contain `..` — so arbitrary params aren't probed.
      # Insertion points come from the shared `InsertionPoints` model (query today).
