      # Active remote-file-inclusion probe, OUT-OF-BAND. When an include/require path is
      # assembled from a request parameter, replacing an existing path-like value with an
      # attacker-controlled remote resource can make the target fetch (and, on vulnerable
      # runtimes, execute) code from outside the application. The request sent to the target
      # does not carry a reliable in-band proof: a successful include can return the same page,
      # suppress errors, or execute in a background path. The OAST callback is therefore the
      # confirmation seam, just as it is for blind SSRF.
      #
      # The probe deliberately stays close to the captured surface:
      #   * it runs only with a registered OAST minter, so a project without a listener does not
      #     spend requests on a check it cannot confirm;
      #   * it considers only an existing include-shaped slot — a URL/path/filename value, or a
      #     conventional file/page/template/lang parameter — and probes the first one only;
      #   * the default method gate is GET/HEAD, while unsafe methods require the same explicit
      #     opt-in as SsrfOast; eligible form/JSON body slots are covered when that gate passes;
      #   * the generated URL carries a marker and a language-shaped wrapper in its query. A
      #     custom OAST resource that echoes or serves that marker can distinguish execution from
      #     a bare fetch; the generic callback still remains the provider-agnostic proof path.
