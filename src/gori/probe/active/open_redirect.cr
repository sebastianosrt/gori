      # parameter (`/login?next=https://app.example/…` → `Location: https://app.example/…`), an
      # attacker can point that parameter at their own host and turn the trusted link into an
      # arbitrary redirect (phishing, OAuth token theft). Passive analysis cannot prove the parameter
      # *controls* the target.
      #
      # For one in-scope flow whose captured response was a 3xx AND whose `Location` a query
      # parameter demonstrably DROVE — the param's value carries the same authority as an absolute
      # `Location`, or IS the path of a relative one — it re-sends ONE request with that parameter
      # replaced by a synthetic external host, and flags High only when the response `Location`
      # redirects to OUR probe host.
      #
      # Low-FP by construction:
      #   * gated to a parameter whose value already accounts for the captured redirect target — a
      #     stray reflected value that doesn't drive the redirect is never probed;
      #   * confirmation parses the response `Location`'s OWN authority (Active.url_authority), so a
      #     relative `Location: /go?next=…probe…` (probe host only in a sub-param) and the
      #     `https://probe@evil.test/` userinfo trick are both correctly rejected;
      #   * the probe host is a reserved `.example` (RFC 2606) that never resolves — only ever a

        #   * `Location` is RELATIVE — the param whose value IS that path. This is the shape the
