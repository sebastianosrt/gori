      # Active missing-authorization probe for Next.js Server Actions.
      #
      # A Next.js `"use server"` function is invoked by a POST to its page route carrying a
      # `Next-Action: <hash id>` request header (and a JSON-array body of the arguments). The
      # framework does NOT authenticate or authorize these RPC endpoints for you — every action
      # must gate itself — so an action that reads or mutates privileged data but forgets the
      # check is a broken-access-control hole. Passive analysis can only note whether a *captured*
      # invocation happened to carry a session cookie; it cannot prove the server actually
      # ENFORCES it. (This is the security-relevant core of yassinebk/CaidoNextJSActionsAnalyzer,
      # turned from a passive "no auth headers observed" note into a confirming probe.)
      #
      # For one in-scope flow that invoked an action WITH credentials (Cookie / Authorization) and
      # got a 2xx, this re-sends the SAME request with those credentials stripped. If the action
      # still returns a comparable 2xx — not a login redirect, a 401/403, or an in-band
      # "unauthorized" payload — the authorization check is likely missing. Reported Medium
      # "possible": it is a single-shot test against the captured baseline and a legitimately
      # public action would also answer, so it is a lead to confirm manually — the same framing as
      # ForbiddenBypass, on which this rule's request-rebuild and status-flip logic are modelled.
      #
      # Gated to allow_unsafe because server actions are POST: the automatic scan never re-sends a
      # POST (SAFE_METHODS), so this runs only under the manual per-flow "Run active scan" with
      # unsafe methods ticked, or AGGRESSIVE mode. A rare GET-invoked action is safe to re-send and
      # is probed by default.
