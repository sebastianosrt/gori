      # Active IP-header access-control bypass probe. Many gateways/apps gate a resource on the
      # *claimed* client IP (an allowlist, an "internal only" path, an admin panel), trusting a
      # proxy header like X-Forwarded-For instead of the real socket peer. Passive analysis can't
      # tell such a control apart from any other 403/401; re-sending the SAME request with a
      # spoofed loopback IP in those headers surfaces a candidate header-controllable gate.
      #
      # For one in-scope flow whose captured response was 401/403, it sends TWO requests:
      #   probe   = the same request + the full IP-spoofing header set (all 127.0.0.1)
      #   control = the same request, UNCHANGED
      # and flags a Medium "possible bypass" only when the probe is 2xx AND the control is still
      # denied. The control is what makes the finding attributable: comparing against the CAPTURED
      # status alone could not tell "the headers opened the gate" from "the 403 was transient and
      # had already cleared by the time we probed" — a rate-limited or flapping endpoint produced a
      # bypass finding with no bypass. The control is sent AFTER the probe, so a 403 that cleared on
      # its own answers 2xx there too and the finding is suppressed.
      #
      # Still Medium, not High: two adjacent requests cannot rule out a load balancer whose backends
      # disagree, so this remains a lead to confirm — just no longer one that fires on ordinary
      # flapping. Gated to safe methods (GET/HEAD) so an automatic probe never mutates server state,
      # and to originally-denied responses so a normally-200 endpoint is never probed. A control
      # that correctly keys on the socket peer ignores the headers and still returns 401/403.
