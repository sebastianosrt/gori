      # Active access-control bypass probe via PATH NORMALIZATION (sibling of ForbiddenBypass, which
      # forges client-IP headers; this one mangles the path). A gateway and its backend often disagree
      # on how a path normalizes: the proxy enforces the ACL on the literal `/admin` but the backend
      # collapses `/admin/..;/admin`, `/./admin`, `/%2e/admin`, a trailing `%2e`/`%20`, … back to
      # `/admin` and serves it. Passive analysis cannot tell such a control apart from any 401/403.
      #
      # For one in-scope flow whose captured response was 401/403, it re-requests the SAME resource
      # through a small set of normalization tricks, plus a CONTROL request for the canonical path
      # exactly as captured, and flags a Medium "possible bypass" when a variant flips to 2xx AND
      # the control is still denied. The control is what makes the flip attributable: judging the
      # variants against the CAPTURED status alone could not tell "the proxy ACL disagrees with the
      # backend" from "the 403 was transient and had already cleared", so a rate-limited or flapping
      # endpoint produced a bypass finding for every variant at once. The control is sent LAST, so a
      # gate that opened on its own answers 2xx there too and the whole finding is suppressed.
      #
      # Still Medium: two adjacent requests cannot rule out backends that disagree, so this remains
      # a lead — just no longer one that fires on ordinary flapping. Gated to safe methods (GET/HEAD
      # — the confirmation is a status flip, which HEAD provides) and to originally-denied responses,
      # so a normally-served endpoint is never probed. A control that normalizes correctly answers
      # every variant with the same 401/403 and is never flagged.
      #
      # Every variant is chosen to resolve to the ORIGINAL resource (`/admin`), NOT to `/admin/`: a
      # bare trailing slash legitimately 200s on many servers, so tricks that canonicalize to `path/`
      # (`/admin/.`, `/admin/./`, `/admin//`) are deliberately EXCLUDED as a false-positive vector.
