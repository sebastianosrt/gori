      # Active Host-header injection probe (web-cache poisoning / password-reset poisoning). Many apps
      # build absolute URLs — reset links, canonical tags, redirects — from the incoming `Host` /
      # `X-Forwarded-Host` instead of a fixed configured host. If that reflected value lands in a
      # cacheable response, an attacker poisons the shared cache for every visitor; if it lands in a
      # password-reset email, the reset link points at the attacker.
      #
      # For one in-scope flow this re-sends ONE safe-method request carrying a synthetic
      # `X-Forwarded-Host: gori-host-probe.example` and flags Medium only when that reserved host comes
      # back as the AUTHORITY of an absolute URL in the response `Location` or body. A server that uses
      # a configured canonical host ignores the header and never reflects it.
      #
      # Gated to keep it quiet and low-FP: only flows whose captured response is host-reflection-prone
      # — either cacheable (a `public` / positive `max-age` Cache-Control, not `no-store`/`private`) or
      # already reflecting its OWN Host as a URL authority in Location/body. Confirmation requires the
      # probe host at an AUTHORITY position (Active.url_authority / a `//host` boundary scan), so a
      # bare mention or the `//probe@evil` userinfo trick does not fire. NOTE: this rule's dedup_key is
