      # Active error-based SQL injection probe. When a query parameter is concatenated into a SQL
      # statement, a value that BREAKS the SQL string/number literal makes the database refuse to
      # parse the statement, and a verbose backend echoes the parser's own diagnostic ("You have an
      # error in your SQL syntax…", `ORA-00933`, "Unclosed quotation mark after the character
      # string…") straight into the response. That leaked, database-specific error message is the
      # tell this rule confirms.
      #
      # For each injectable parameter it sends a baseline (the ORIGINAL request, unchanged) plus one
      # probe per param whose value is the param's ORIGINAL value with a syntax-breaking suffix
      # appended (URL-encoded `'"`), every other param left alone. A param is flagged ONLY when a
      # specific DB-error signature appears in the PROBE body and is ABSENT from the baseline body.
      #
      # Two FP guards stack — the same shape the SSTI rule uses to prove EVALUATION rather than
      # reflection:
      #   * the DIFFERENTIAL — the signature must be present after the break and absent before it.
      #     An endpoint that is PERMANENTLY broken (always renders a DB error, e.g. a misconfigured
      #     page) carries the signature in the baseline too, so the difference is empty and nothing
      #     fires. Only a NEW error induced by our syntax break counts.
      #   * a SPECIFIC signature we NEVER send ourselves — the payload is only `'"`, never any of the
      #     signature strings, so a matched signature is the database talking, not our input echoed
      #     back. (Ordinary reflection of the `'"` payload — with no DB error — matches nothing.)
      # The signature set is deliberately narrow (curated DB diagnostics, no bare "error"/"sql"/
      # "syntax"), matched case-insensitively against the DECODED, scrubbed, capped body text so an
      # invalid-UTF-8 byte can never make the PCRE `ORA-\d{5}` scan raise.
      #
      # This COMPLEMENTS `backslash_powered`, which is structural and error-message-FREE (it reads a
      # `\` vs `\\` asymmetry and never needs the backend to leak a string). This rule instead
      # catches the endpoints that DO leak a verbose DB error — including NUMERIC contexts (`id=42`
      # → `id=42'"`), where the backslash-escaping asymmetry does not appear because a lone `\` in a
      # numeric literal is not an escape. The two together cover both the quiet (structural) and the
      # loud (error-leaking) faces of the same injection surface. Insertion points come from the
      # shared `InsertionPoints` model (query today).
