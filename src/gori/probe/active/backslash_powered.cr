      # Backslash-powered scanning (James Kettle, PortSwigger 2016 —
      # https://portswigger.net/research/backslash-powered-scanning-hunting-unknown-vulnerability-classes).
      # The idea: tell whether a parameter is treated as inert DATA or is fed to a server-side
      # string INTERPRETER (SQL, a template/expression engine, a shell, …) — without relying on a
      # specific error message — by exploiting how a backslash escapes.
      #
      # For each parameter it sends three requests that carry the param's ORIGINAL value with a
      # suffix appended:
      #   baseline  value          (unchanged)
      #   single    value\         (a lone trailing backslash)
      #   double    value\\        (an escaped, i.e. literal, backslash)
      # A value that is pure data is unaffected by either suffix, so all three responses match. But
      # inside a string interpreter the LONE `\` escapes the next character (often the closing
      # delimiter) and breaks parsing, while the DOUBLED `\\` is just a literal backslash and parses
      # cleanly. So the tell is an ASYMMETRY: `single` differs from `baseline` while `double` matches
      # it. That asymmetry — not any single error string — is what flags a probable injection surface.
      #
      # The comparison assumes the endpoint answers the same request the same way twice, so it sends
      # the baseline TWICE and reports nothing unless the two agree: on an endpoint that varies on
      # its own (an intermittent 503, a rate limiter, a rotating backend) noise landing on a `\` leg
      # but not its `\\` leg reproduces this exact asymmetry, once per probed param. Measuring the
      # endpoint against itself turns "we cannot tell" into a decline instead of a finding.
      #
      # This is the active scanner's first DIFFERENTIAL (multi-probe) rule: `plan` builds two
      # baselines plus a `\`/`\\` pair per param into `Plan.followups`, the analyzer sends them all,
      # and `detections_all` compares the responses. The differential compares BODIES, so HEAD is always
      # out; by default GET only (POST/PUT/… are never auto-probed — they mutate state), but an
      # explicit opt-in (Options#allow_unsafe: the manual per-flow scan or AGGRESSIVE mode) widens
      # it to any body-bearing method. Capped at MAX_PROBE_PARAMS params (raised under AGGRESSIVE)
      # so a wide param set can't blow up the request count. Insertion points come from the shared
      # `InsertionPoints` model (query today).
