      # Active rate-limit bypass probe (429). Many rate limiters bucket by the CLAIMED client IP —
      # an X-Forwarded-For / X-Real-IP the app trusts instead of the socket peer — so an attacker
      # who forges that header gets a fresh bucket and sidesteps the limit (credential stuffing,
      # scraping, brute force). Passive analysis cannot tell a header-keyed limiter apart from any
      # other 429: re-sending the SAME request with a spoofed IP surfaces the header-controllable case.
      #
      # For one in-scope flow whose captured response was 429, it sends TWO requests:
      #   probe   = the same request + the client-IP spoofing header set (ForbiddenBypass's set)
      #   control = the same request, UNCHANGED
      # and flags a Medium bypass only when the probe was SERVED (2xx/3xx) AND the control is still
      # 429. The control — sent AFTER the probe — is what makes the finding attributable: judging
      # the probe against the captured 429 alone could not tell "the header reset the bucket" from
      # "the window simply elapsed between capture and probe". If the limit cleared on its own, the
      # control answers non-429 too and the finding is suppressed.
      #
      # Still Medium: two adjacent requests cannot rule out a limiter whose window happened to roll
      # over between them, so this is a lead to confirm — just no longer one that fires on ordinary
      # window expiry. Gated to safe methods (GET/HEAD) so an automatic probe never mutates state.
      # The IP-header list is ForbiddenBypass's (one source of truth for "spoofable client-IP
      # headers"); the two rules differ only in trigger status and success condition.
