    # A user-defined passive match rule: a string or regex tested against one region of a
    # captured flow (request/response × header/body/whole). Unlike a built-in Passive::Rule it
    # carries its own metadata + match spec as data (no Crystal subclass) and is persisted either
    # GLOBALLY (Settings.scan_rules, reusable across projects) or per-PROJECT (probe_custom_rules).
    # `Probe.custom_rules(store)` merges both into the runtime list the analyzer feeds to
    # Passive.analyze. A match emits a Category::CUSTOM Detection grouped by (code, host) like any
    # built-in finding.
    #
    # SAFETY: user patterns run PCRE over captured bytes. Every region text Context hands us is
    # already `.scrub`bed, and #matches? rescues a bad-pattern raise → false, so a hostile regex
    # or a non-UTF-8 body can never crash the scanner (mirrors the built-in rules' scrub+rescue).
    #
    # `kind: "exec"` (#818) is the third kind and the one that leaves Crystal: `pattern` holds an
    # ARGV, the region is fed to that command on stdin, and its EXIT CODE is the verdict — 0
    # raises the finding, anything else does not. stdout becomes the evidence line, which is what
    # makes an exec rule worth having over a regex: a real detector can say *what* it found. It
    # runs with the operator's own privileges and is not sandboxed; see `Gori::ProcessHook`.

      # goes through — it is a detector's own text landing in a stored row and in the TUI.
      #
      # A hook that cannot RUN — no such command, timed out, wrote past
      # `ProcessHook::MAX_OUTPUT` — is NOT a match, and is reported through `report_failure`.
      # Both halves matter. Treating a spawn failure as a hit would fill the Issues list from a
      # typo; treating it as a clean no-match and saying nothing is the shape my notes call
      # "absence of finding reads as clean" — the operator cannot tell "the detector looked and
      # found nothing" from "the detector never ran". A non-zero exit is neither: it is the
      # rule's own answer and is silent by design.
      #
      # COST. This runs ONCE PER FLOW, on the passive analyzer's fiber, and it is the only
      # custom-rule kind that can take real time. A hook that needs two seconds makes
      # `Probe.scan_detail` the bottleneck for the whole rule set, and `Store#publish` drops
      # onto `@probe_events` when that channel backs up (best-effort, no catch-up sweep) — so
      # under live capture a slow exec rule can leave later flows unanalyzed by EVERY passive
      # rule, with a Probe tab that still looks clean. `hooks.timeout_secs` is the ceiling on
      # one run; the operator picking a slow detector is picking that cost per flow. Keep an
      # exec rule's command fast, or scope the rules it competes with.
      #
      # WHAT THE HOOK SEES is the region text `Passive::Context` hands every custom rule —
      # content-decoded, capped at `Context::BODY_CAP`, and `.scrub`bed. That is a real
      # departure from P7's raw octets and it is deliberate: a rule table where `exec` and
      # `regex` looked at different bytes for the same {side, region} would make two rules over
      # one flow mean two different things. A hook that needs the exact wire bytes has the flow
