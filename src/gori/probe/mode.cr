module Gori
  # Probe — the passive + lightweight-active scanner. It analyzes proxied traffic as it is
  # captured (zero-request passive checks) and, when armed, confirms reflected parameters
  # with a handful of in-scope probes. Issues are GROUPED by (code, host) into
  # Store::ProbeIssue rows; technology fingerprints (category "tech") double as the
  # project's "representative technologies" surfaced in the Project tab.
  #
  # Headless-friendly: the engine (passive/active) has no TUI dependency, so the analyzer
  # runs for both the TUI and `gori run capture`. Only the analyzer touches Store/Scope.

    # (reflected params today) over hosts/paths covered by Project scope rules only — the `s`
    # display lens need not be on; one probe per unique target. Keep Active DELIBERATELY quiet:
    # safe-method only, low-volume (a handful of confirming probes), one probe per unique target.
    #
    # Aggressive = Active's sanctioned louder tier for AUTHORIZED targets: raised per-rule caps
    # (wider param sets), a wider bypass-header set, and — unlike Active — it also probes
    # UNSAFE methods (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE), so an in-scope endpoint can be state-mutated by the
    # automatic pipeline. It is still Project-scope-gated (never widens scope) and still "more of
    # the same probes with relaxed caps", NOT an unbounded flood of attack payloads.
