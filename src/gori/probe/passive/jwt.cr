      # request `Cookie` value, and a response `Set-Cookie` value — reporting five things the
      # header/payload declare outright:
      #
      #   * `alg: "none"`      — an unsigned token in live use (High; unmistakable binary signal)
      #   * a non-standard alg — outside the JWA JWS registry, so the verifier's handling of it
      #                          is anyone's guess (Low)
      #   * no `exp` claim     — the token never expires on its own (Low)
      #   * sensitive claims   — role/permission/PII claim NAMES in the payload (Info)
      #   * `jku`/`x5u`/`jwk`  — key-resolution parameters in the HEADER: the token telling the
      #                          verifier which key to trust (Medium)

      # Zero-request and DECODE-ONLY: passive analysis cannot verify a signature or recover a
      # secret, so nothing here asserts the server would *accept* a tampered token — that is the
      # manual/active `jwt_attacks` path (Workbench → JWT, `gori run jwt`, MCP `jwt_attacks`).

      # Evidence is SAFE by construction: an alg name, claim names, and the carrying header /
      # cookie name — never the token, a claim VALUE, or the signature.

      # Deliberately NOT flagged: a plain `HS256` token. Symmetric HMAC is the correct, dominant
      # configuration for a first-party API, and "HS256 where an asymmetric alg was expected" is
      # not passively knowable — flagging it would fire on nearly every host for no signal.
