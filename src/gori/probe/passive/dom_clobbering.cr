      # DOM clobbering suspicion (category "client"). Passive detection of clobbering is
      # inherently heuristic — you cannot see, without executing the page, whether an
      # attacker-influenced id/name element exists — so this stays Info and keys on two
      # high-precision code patterns that indicate reliance on a clobberable global:
      #   * named access into a live HTMLCollection (document.forms[…], document.all[…], …),
      #     which an injected `<… name=x>` / `<… id=x>` can shadow; and
      #   * the `window.X = window.X || …` fallback idiom, which trusts a global that a
      #     clobbering element could pre-populate.
      # Scans the STRIPPED code (Context#client_code) so a mention inside a string/comment
      # doesn't false-match.

        # fired on ubiquitous benign iteration like `document.images[0]`. Runs over stripped
        # client_code, which blanks a string's contents but KEEPS its opening quote, so the

        # `window.foo = window.foo || "…"` — reads a global back before defining it; a clobbering
        # element with that id/name can have already set it. Backreference pins both sides.
        #
        # The trailing `["'`]` is what makes this a finding rather than a description of every
        # bundle on the web. What a clobbering element puts in a global is an ELEMENT (or an
        # HTMLCollection), so the idiom is only a gadget when the code goes on to use the value
        # AS A STRING — a CDN base, an API URL, a template path — because that is where an
        # `<a id=cdnBase href="//evil">` stringifies into the slot. The namespace-initialising
        # forms (`|| {}`, `|| []`, `|| require(…)`, `|| someIdentifier`) are the UMD / polyfill /
        # analytics preamble: `window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || []` is Google Tag Manager's
        # documented snippet, and `window.X = window.X || {}` opens essentially every UMD bundle.
        # Matching those made this rule fire on every script on the internet — against the
        # "two high-precision code patterns" this file's header promises — while clobbering one
        # of them with an element breaks the page loudly instead of exploiting it. Runs over

        # so the string-literal form still matches post-strip.
