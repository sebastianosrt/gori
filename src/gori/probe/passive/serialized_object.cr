      # A Java/.NET/PHP object graph round-tripping through a cookie, a parameter, or an ASP.NET
      # ViewState field is the classic insecure-deserialization surface: if the server hands the
      # blob back to a native deserializer without integrity protection, a crafted object graph
      # is remote code execution (ysoserial, ViewState gadgets, PHP POP chains). Passive

      # PRECISION over recall, like the sibling `exposed_config`. Every signature is a serialized
      # stream's MAGIC PREFIX matched in a VALUE POSITION (a cookie value, a query/body parameter
      # value, a hidden-field value), never a keyword scanned across a whole body. The magics are
      # so distinctive — `rO0AB` is base64 for Java's `AC ED 00 05` stream header, `AAEAAAD/////`
      # is base64 for the .NET BinaryFormatter record header — that a value-position prefix match
      # is effectively zero-FP. `/wE` (base64 `FF 01`) is shorter, so it is only ever read as a
      # serialized surface when it sits in a value position AND is followed by a base64 run, and
      # an ENCRYPTED ViewState (opaque base64 that does not begin `/wE`) is deliberately NOT
      # flagged — encryption is the fix, so flagging it would punish the secure configuration.
