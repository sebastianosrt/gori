      # `secret_in_body` rule covers that. This is the whole FILE being readable: a deployed
      # `.env`, a `.git/config`, a `phpinfo()` page, an `.htpasswd`, a Spring `/actuator/env`.
      # One of these is usually the shortest path from recon to credentials, and every one of

      # its own.

      # PRECISION over recall, deliberately. Every signature is anchored on the exact structural
      # shape the artifact has — `[core]` immediately followed by `repositoryformatversion`, a
      # `<title>phpinfo()</title>`, an Apache MD5 crypt hash — never on a keyword that a page
      # ABOUT the artifact would also carry. The FP that matters here is a tutorial, a docs
      # site, or a config reference showing the same text, and that is what the two-marker /
      # structural anchoring (the `directory_listing` pattern) is for.
      #
      # Every signature is anchored on a literal PCRE can skip a clean body on, and the scan is
      # bounded to the response's opening SCAN_PREFIX bytes — this rule reads the body of every
      # texty 2xx response.
