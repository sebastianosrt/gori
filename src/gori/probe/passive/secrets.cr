          #
          #   * a Google OAuth CLIENT ID (`<digits>-<32>.apps.googleusercontent.com`). It is
          #     public by construction — the browser carries it in the authorization URL of every
          #     Google Sign-In redirect, and Google documents it as non-secret. So this fired
          #     High on every site using Google Sign-In: the exact JWT failure described below,
          #     one tier up. Dropped rather than given its own Info code, because unlike a JWT it
          #     says nothing an analyst can act on beyond "this site uses Google Sign-In", which
          #     is a `tech` fingerprint's job. The CREDENTIAL half of that pair is the client
          #     secret, and it does have a shape — `GOCSPX-`, added below — so removing the id
          #     costs no coverage of the thing that actually matters.
          #   * a Mapbox PUBLIC token (`pk.`). Mapbox issues `pk.` precisely to be embedded in
          #     client-side JS and it can only carry public scopes; `sk.` is the secret half.
          #     Restricted to `sk\.` below, so a site simply drawing a map is no longer a High.
          #

          # this loop: `\b\d{6,}` anchors PCRE on "a digit", so in a minified bundle it retried
