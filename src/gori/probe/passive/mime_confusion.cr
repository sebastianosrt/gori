      # MIME type confusion (category "headers"): the BODY the server sent and the Content-Type
      # it declared disagree, in one of the two shapes a browser can be talked into rendering as
      # HTML. Zero-request and response-gated — everything below is read off the captured flow.
      #
      # Case 1 — `mime_sniff_html`: the body plainly IS an HTML/script document, but it is served
      # under a type browsers content-sniff, with no `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`. All three
      # conditions are load-bearing and the rule fires only when every one holds:
      #
      #   * the body sniffs as HTML — a leading `<!doctype html` / `<html` / `<head` / `<body` /
      #     `<script` / `<svg`, or a `<script` inside the sniffed prefix. Anything vaguer (a lone
      #     `<` , a `<p>` in prose) is not markup a sniffer commits on, and would be noise;
      #   * the DECLARED type is one browsers actually sniff. That set is small: a missing
      #     Content-Type, `text/plain`, and `application/octet-stream`. `application/json` and the
      #     other `application/*` types are deliberately EXCLUDED — modern browsers do not
      #     upgrade those to HTML, so an HTML-looking JSON body is a mislabelling curiosity, not
      #     an XSS. `text/html` is excluded too: an HTML body under `text/html` is simply correct;
      #   * `nosniff` is ABSENT. `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` is precisely the switch that
      #     tells the browser to honour the declared type and never sniff — with it present the
      #     body is rendered as text/downloaded and there is no path to execution, so firing
      #     would be a pure false positive. (SecurityHeaders separately flags the header's absence
      #     as a hardening gap; this rule only cares that its absence turns a sniffable body into
      #     a live one.)
      #
      #   Together they describe the classic MIME-sniffing XSS: an upload/echo endpoint that
      #   stores attacker markup and serves it back as `text/plain`, which IE/legacy sniffers —
      #   and, for `application/octet-stream` downloads opened in-page, still today's — will
      #   happily execute in the site's origin.
      #
      # Case 2 — `mime_json_as_html`: the body is real JSON but the response claims `text/html`.
      # The browser then parses an API payload as a document: any value echoing user input that
      # contains markup is rendered, not escaped, which is a stored/reflected XSS with no need
      # for sniffing at all. The label is wrong regardless, which is why this is reported even
      # when nosniff IS present — nosniff enforces the declared type, and here the declared type
      # is the dangerous one.
      #
      #   The FP guard is that the body must ACTUALLY PARSE as JSON, not merely open with a brace.
      #   A genuine HTML page can start with `{` (a templating artefact, a stray `{{ }}` mustache,
      #   a CSS-ish preamble), and a prefix test alone flagged those. Requiring `JSON.parse` to
      #   succeed makes the check exact: only a document that a JSON consumer would accept counts.
      #   The parse runs inside a rescue (malformed input IS the payload here), and it is reached
      #   only for the small slice of traffic that both declares text/html and opens with `{`/`[`,
      #   so the tree build is not on the general passive path. Note the body text is capped
      #   (Context::BODY_CAP), so a JSON document larger than the cap parses as truncated and does
      #   NOT fire — a deliberate miss rather than a guess.
      #
      # Byte-safety: `ctx.body_text` arrives already content-decoded, capped and `.scrub`bed, so
      # every test here is a plain String operation — no PCRE over raw bytes.
