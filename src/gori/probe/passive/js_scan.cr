      # the tree and a per-flow passive scan can't afford one, so this is deliberately a
      # heuristic — NOT a real AST taint analysis. Two services:
      #
      #   * `scripts` extracts the executable JS out of a response: each inline <script> body
      #     from an HTML page, or the whole body of a JS response. Externals (`src=`) and
      #     non-JS <script type> blocks (json/template/importmap) are skipped.
      #   * `strip` blanks out comments and string/template literals, replacing their CONTENTS
      #     with spaces (offsets preserved). What remains is *code*: a sink/source keyword that
      #     lived inside a string or comment ("use innerHTML safely", // TODO location.hash)
      #     can no longer produce a false match, and a rule can still measure source<->sink
      #     proximity on the cleaned text because character indices line up with the original.
      #
      # DOM XSS runs over the STRIPPED code (Context#client_code) so string/comment noise is
