      # Source maps shipped alongside a production script (category "infoleak"): a
      # `//# sourceMappingURL=…` comment (or a `SourceMap:` / `X-SourceMap:` response header)
      # hands anyone the recipe for reconstructing the ORIGINAL sources — pre-minification names,
      # developer comments, internal paths, dead code, sometimes whole unshipped modules.
      #
      # The reference itself is the binary signal, so the check is exact: either the comment/
      # header is there or it isn't. What passive analysis CANNOT do is fetch the `.map` to prove
      # it's actually served (many builds emit the comment but never deploy the file), so a plain
      # reference is Info, "verify the .map is reachable". An INLINE map (`data:` URI) needs no
      # such verification — the sources are embedded in the very response we captured — so that
      # one is Low.
      #
      # JS responses only. A CSS `sourceMappingURL` is the same class of exposure but a much
      # smaller one (a preprocessor's stylesheet), and is left out to keep the rule's signal high.

        # it is a naive byte search, while PCRE2 memchr-skips a pure literal in 69.5µs. Same
