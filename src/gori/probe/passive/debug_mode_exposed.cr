      # A web framework's DEBUG mode / interactive debugger / profiler reachable in production
      # (category "infoleak"). This is deliberately DISTINCT from the sibling `error_stack_leak`,
      # which flags any stack trace in a body: here the signal is a framework's own debug UI —
      # Symfony's profiler, Werkzeug's / Rails' interactive console, Laravel's Whoops/Ignition,
      # the Django technical-error page, ASP.NET detailed errors. Two things follow that a generic
      # trace does not carry: the remediation is specific and singular ("turn debug off"), and
      # some of these pages are live REMOTE-CODE-EXECUTION consoles, not merely disclosure — so
      # they earn High while a profiler/error page is Medium.
      #
      # PRECISION over recall: every marker is a string the debug UI emits about ITSELF (a
      # console title, a profiler header, a framework version banner that only the debug page
      # renders), never a word a page ABOUT the framework would carry. Body markers are gated to
      # HTML responses; the header marker is content-type-agnostic (it rides every response while
      # the profiler is on).

        # this rule that was a straight PESSIMISATION: `String#includes?` is a naive byte search,
        # while PCRE2 skips a non-matching subject with its own start optimization. Over a 64 KiB
        # HTML body one `includes?` cost ~85µs and the pattern it guarded cost ~19µs, so every
        # HTML flow paid ~600µs to save nothing — the rule was the second most expensive on a
        # large document. Same finding, same file-level shape, as the `includes?`-before-regex
        # guards removed elsewhere in this tree: never hand-roll a prefilter in front of
        # something that already prefilters itself, and settle it by measurement.
        #

        # LITERAL REGEX (~19µs, not an `includes?`) only where the confirming pattern genuinely
        # cannot anchor itself — today just the Rails web-console alternation, which opens on
