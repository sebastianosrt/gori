      # directions) with the same high-confidence credential shapes as BodyLeaks — evidence is the
      # TYPE label only, never the matched value.
      #
      # BINARY frames are scanned too, which reverses an earlier decision (a spec asserted "binary
      # frames are ignored" without recording why). protobuf / msgpack / CBOR over WebSocket is the
      # mainstream encoding for realtime APIs, and a token rides in such a frame as an ordinary
      # ASCII string field — so ignoring them was a straight false negative on the very transport
      # this rule exists for. No deframing is needed and none is done: every shape in
      # `Secrets::PATTERNS` is a literal ASCII vendor prefix plus a fixed-charset tail, which
      # survives the projection below intact.
