      #   * only a reference whose scheme/host/port differs from the page's is flagged;
      #   * only `<script src>` and `<link rel=stylesheet>`, the two subresource types browsers
      #     actually enforce `integrity` on today.
      # Evidence is the external HOST, not the URL, so one issue per host names its third
      # parties (they accumulate across flows) without dragging cache-busted paths along.
