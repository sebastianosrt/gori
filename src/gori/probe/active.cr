      # The WHOLE probe request, marked as bytes the session-binding pass must copy through
      # untouched (`Fuzz::Backend#send`'s `verbatim`). Not a convenience — the provenance of
      # every byte in `plan.request` is "something other than an operator writing a `$NAME`":
      #
      #   * Every rule in `active/` builds its request from the CAPTURED request
      #     (`detail.request_head` / `detail.request_body` / `detail.row`) and splices in its
      #     own gori-generated canary. Real captured traffic is full of `$NAME`-shaped bytes
      #     nobody typed — Mongo `$ne`/`$gt`/`$where`, JSON Schema `$ref`/`$schema`, and a
      #     GraphQL operation, which is MADE of `$variable` references (we ship a GraphQL rule
      #     precisely because we expect to see them). The `$`+`[A-Za-z_]`+`[A-Za-z0-9_]*`
      #     grammar has no delimiter requirement, so with an extract rule named `id` up, the
      #     captured `query GetUser($id: ID!)` went out as
      #     `query GetUser(<live session token>: ID!)` — a real credential in the target's
      #     access log, inside a request nobody authored (and no longer valid GraphQL, so the
      #     rule's differential measured a parse error), while the scan reported itself clean.
      #   * No rule authors a `$NAME` of its own: `grep '\$[A-Za-z_]' active/*.cr` is empty
      #     outside comments. And no operator STRING reaches a rule at all — `Options` is two
      #     Bools (allow_unsafe, aggressive). This is an automated sweep over stored evidence,
      #     not an operator draft: there is no editor, no `--payloads`, no template here.
      #
      # So there is nothing in this buffer that is eligible to expand, and one span covering
      # it is the honest description — not a blunt instrument standing in for per-rule spans.
      # (The miner's `Inject.apply_with_spans` marks the INJECTED material verbatim and lets
      # the captured seed resolve; here the polarity is inverted, because here the captured
      # request IS the test case rather than the template around it.)
      #
      # The one caller carrying operator-authored bytes is `Scan.scan_repeaters`, whose
      # `detail_from_repeater` blob is a MIX of editor text and a captured seed with no
      # provenance marks anywhere in the store — there is no span to track, so the choice is
      # expand-everything or expand-nothing. Nothing is load-bearing on that path today
      # anyway: it bypasses `Repeater::Plan`, so an env var `$KEY` already goes out literal
      # and only a session binding ever resolved. Erring to "nothing expands" costs a visible
      # 401 on a probe; erring the other way costs a live credential on the wire, silently.
      # Widening this back is a provenance signal on FlowDetail, never a re-widening here.
      #
      # Spelled as `Fuzz::Backend.all_verbatim` at every call site — including the SECOND send
      # loop in `Probe::Analyzer#execute_active` (the live TUI path, which never enters
      # `.analyze`). The reason this defect survived is that the two loops look
      # interchangeable, so they share one spelling and cannot drift again.
      #
      # Probe marks whole-buffer AT THE CALL SITE rather than taking `Fuzz::Sender`'s
      # `evidence:` flag, because of the inverted polarity argued above: the flag says "this
      # engine's buffer is a capture", which is true here, but probe reaches the sender through
      # `Scan.scan_repeaters` too, whose blob is mixed. Marking at the call site keeps the
      # decision next to the reasoning for it.
      #
      # (This block documents the four `Fuzz::Backend.all_verbatim` call sites below and in
      # `Probe::Analyzer#execute_active`. It used to document a `Probe::Active.all_verbatim`
      # twin of the same one-liner; the two were collapsed onto `Fuzz::Backend`'s, which is the
      # type every call site already holds.)

      # Synchronously execute enabled Active rules against a flow (for headless / CLI scans).
      # `outbound` is the REQUIRED scope decision (Gori::Outbound): a Sandbox block or an
      # explicit exclude rule HARD-blocks the probe at the socket seam even when the caller
      # bypassed its own include gate (--allow-unscoped). Required rather than optional
      # precisely so a new caller cannot forget it.
      # `overrides` is the project's HOST OVERRIDES table, and it is REQUIRED for exactly the
      # same reason — retroactively. It was `Fuzz::Sender`'s optional trailing argument, this
      # method never named it at all, and so every probe gori has ever sent from a headless
      # scan dialed whatever DNS resolved while the operator's routing table sat there being
      # ignored. Nothing failed and nothing was logged: the probes went out, the findings were
      # real findings about the WRONG host. Optionality is what made that possible, so it is
      # gone. Nil is still a legitimate value (a spec with an injected backend has no project),
      # but it is now a value someone chose.
      #
      # It cannot widen containment. The override moves only the TCP connect target;
      # `Fuzz::Origin`'s host is what `outbound` judged and what SNI, the certificate check and
      # the `Host` header keep carrying, so the scope verdict above is computed on the name the
      # operator scoped, never on the address gori ends up dialing.
      # `backend` overrides the default Fuzz::Sender so specs can drive the rules without a
      # socket; it is wrapped in Fuzz::GatedBackend so an injected backend is gated too.
      # `opts` widens the method gate / raises caps (manual unsafe opt-in, AGGRESSIVE mode).
      # `disabled` holds the RuleInfo#ids the operator turned off in the Rules sub-tab — the same
      # set the TUI analyzer filters on before enqueueing (analyzer.cr's maybe_enqueue_active), so
      # a headless scan honours that config too instead of silently running every built-in.
      # `on_error` (optional) is called with the failing rule's id when a rule raises; see the
      # per-rule rescue below for why that isolation exists at all.
      # `on_oob` (optional) receives each OUT-OF-BAND candidate a plan planted, once its probe
      # actually went out. It is a callback rather than a Store write because this module is
      # deliberately Store-free (rules depend only on the codec, the body decoder and the
      # sender); the caller that owns a Store — `Probe::Scan`, the TUI analyzer — persists it.
