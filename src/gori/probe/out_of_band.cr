module Gori
  module Probe
    # The out-of-band half of the active scanner: the seam between a rule that plants an OAST
    # payload and the callback that proves the target used it.
    #
    # Every other active rule closes its own loop — it writes a request and reads the answer on
    # the same socket. A blind vulnerability has no answer on that socket by definition: the
    # evidence is a DNS/HTTP request the TARGET makes to a third-party interaction server,
    # arriving seconds to hours later through a channel gori is not a party to. So the check is
    # split in two, and neither half knows about the other except through this module:
    #
    #   * PLANT (`Minter`) — at plan time a rule asks for a payload. Minting is a LOCAL call
    #     (`Oast::Provider#generate_payload` is network-free by invariant), so a rule stays a
    #     pure function of (flow, opts) and the planning path keeps costing no sockets. The rule
    #     attaches a `Candidate` to its Plan saying what finding this payload would prove.
    #   * PROMOTE (`.sweep`) — later, a callback carrying that payload's token lands in
    #     `oast_callbacks` (written by whichever surface is polling: the TUI's OAST listener,
    #     `gori run oast`, the MCP tools). The sweep matches it to the stored probe and emits
    #     the Detection.
    #
    # Nothing is emitted on the plant alone. A payload going out is not a finding — the whole
    # value of an out-of-band check is that the target either called home or it didn't — so an
    # unmatched row stays unmatched and says nothing.
    #
    # Named OutOfBand rather than Oast because `Gori::Probe::Oast` would put an `Oast` constant
    # inside `Gori::Probe`, where every existing `Oast::` reference resolves lexically and would
    # silently start pointing at this module instead of the engine.
    module OutOfBand
      # Shortest token the sweep will trust to attribute a callback. Every provider's nonce is
      # at least 8 chars (postbin's is exactly 8); a shorter one is a mis-mint, not a real token.

      # that payload would prove. `token` is the provider-minted nonce (see

      # request, so it is stored as the row's unique key.
