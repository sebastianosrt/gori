    # Zero-request passive checks over a single captured flow. Pure: depends only on the codec,
    # the body decoder, and the protocol detectors — no Store/Scope/TUI. Each check is a self-
    # contained `Passive::Rule` in its own file under `passive/`; `analyze` parses the flow once
    # (Context) and runs every registered rule, returning the raw Detections. The analyzer folds
    # them into grouped Store::ProbeIssue rows.
    #
    # To add a check: drop a new `Rule` subclass in `passive/` and append it to RULES.
