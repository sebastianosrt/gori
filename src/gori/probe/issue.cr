    # The CWE each finding code maps to: {numeric id, CWE name}. This is the vocabulary every
    # downstream consumer already speaks — a report template, a Jira field, a scanner-comparison
    # spreadsheet, an agent asked "does this codebase have any CWE-79" — and gori was the only
    # part of that chain that could not answer it.
    #
    # One CWE per code, chosen as the weakness the finding IS rather than the attack it enables:
    # `missing_hsts` is cleartext transmission (319), not "clickjacking"; `cookie_no_httponly` has
    # its own precise entry (1004) and does not get filed under a generic 200. Where CWE genuinely
    # has no better entry than the abstract "a protection mechanism is absent or ineffective",
    # 693 is used deliberately rather than forcing a specific-sounding but wrong id.
    #
    # DELIBERATELY UNMAPPED, and not an oversight:
    #   * `tech_*` — a fingerprint is a project fact, not a weakness; there is nothing to file.
    #   * `jwt_in_body` / `jwt_in_ws` — Info notes on where tokens flow. Handing the client its
    #     own token is the design (see Secrets::JWT), so stamping a CWE on it would re-create the
    #     exact "a High that fires everywhere" problem splitting these codes out was meant to fix.
    #   * `custom_*` — the operator's own rule; only they know what it means.
    #   * `cookie_broad_domain` — an Info hardening note (a Domain scoped to a parent domain).
    #     No CWE fits it cleanly (1275 is SameSite; 565/732/668 all overreach), so it stays
    #     unmapped rather than borrowing a specific-sounding but wrong id.
    # `cwe` returns nil for these, and every surface omits the field rather than inventing one.
