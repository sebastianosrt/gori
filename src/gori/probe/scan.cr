    # (Probe.group) and rendering live in the callers; this produces only raw Detections.
    #
    # Active scope gating goes through the ONE seam every surface shares (Gori::Outbound),
    # in its usual two layers: Layer-1 (`outbound.allows?`) only SENDS to a flow the project
    # scope INCLUDES, bypassable with allow_unscoped; Layer-2 ALWAYS hands the same Outbound
    # to Active.analyze, whose sender hard-blocks a Sandbox/exclude even under allow_unscoped.

    # loaded); the decision object is built once here so neither caller can build a different one.
