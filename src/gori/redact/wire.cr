  module Redact
    # The body engine applied to a whole HTTP MESSAGE — head plus entity — and the framing
    # repair that has to follow it.
    #
    # Sanitizing a body changes its length, and it usually has to UNDO the transfer the body
    # arrived under to read it at all (a gzipped or chunked entity has no fields to match until
    # it is decoded). A head left describing the captured entity would then be describing an
    # entity that is not there: `Content-Length` off by the difference, `Content-Encoding: gzip`
    # over plain text, `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` over an unframed body. Every consumer of an
    # export is entitled to read those three — curl re-sends the command, a HAR reader renders
    # the entry, the operator eyeballs `--format raw` — so the sanitized head is repaired to
    # describe the sanitized body, and `decoded?` records that the repair happened.
    #
    # ## What this does NOT touch, on purpose
    #
    # The request line and the header block, apart from those three framing fields. A profile
    # describes BODY structure (#1035); a credential in a `Cookie` header or a `?token=` query
    # string is a different axis with its own consumers (`row.target`, a HAR `url`, the copy
    # menu's URL row, curl's argument) that would have to move together or disagree with each
    # other. So the marker every surface prints says "bodies", never "sanitized" unqualified —
    # see `Redact::Report#summary`.
