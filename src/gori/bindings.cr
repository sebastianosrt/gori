module Gori
  # Session bindings (#501): named values observed from a response and resolved into
  # outgoing requests at SEND time.
  #
  #   extraction observes, injection rewrites, and a binding is the only thing between
  #   them. Injection is not a new rule kind — it is the existing rewrite with its
  #   replacement resolved late.
  #
  # So this class owns exactly two things: the persisted `extract_rules` (the READ half)
  # and an IN-MEMORY name→value table (the binding itself). The WRITE half is an ordinary
  # `Store::MatchRule` whose `replacement` says `$NAME`, plus the four send seams that
  # resolve `$NAME` on their way to the socket.
  #
  # **The rule persists; the value never does.** Not in `settings.json`, and — unlike
  # `oast_sessions` — not in the project DB either. Two reasons, and the second is the
  # real one: a restored token is stale by construction (minutes to days old on reopen)
  # and injecting it produces exactly the 401s this feature exists to remove; and
  # re-extracting costs one request, so there is nothing to save.
  #
  # The guarantee is BOUNDED and stated as such: gori never WRITES a binding value into
  # `settings.json`, the project DB, the event feed, an issue, a note, or a log line. It
  # DOES appear in captured traffic, because that is where it came from — masking a
  # capture would be a P7 violation, not a fix. The same exception covers an author's own
  # bytes: a request draft in which the OPERATOR (TUI editor, `gori run repeater`) or an
  # AGENT (MCP `create_repeater`/`update_repeater`) typed the value is stored as typed.
  # Rewriting a draft to `$NAME` is that same P7 violation one surface earlier, and it split
  # the surfaces apart — see `MCP::Tools#stored_request`.
  #
  # One instance is SHARED between the TUI (which edits rules and reads the table), the
  # Repeater send path (which writes it) and every send seam (which reads it), so a Mutex
  # guards both the rule snapshot and the value table. Same contract as `Rules`.

    # Bytes that would forge a message boundary out of a value, so a value carrying one is
    # never bound. `Import::Builder::HEADER_INJECT`, deliberately the same set and the same
    # reasoning: only CR/LF/NUL, because a value may legally contain a horizontal tab and
    # bytes that merely break a value without forging a boundary are not this feature's
    # business.
    #
    # ## Why this is a refusal and not a P7 passthrough
    #
    # The axis is PROVENANCE. Everywhere else in this codebase a malformed value is the
    # OPERATOR'S PAYLOAD and is replayed byte-exact — an imported target, a hand-typed header,
    # a Repeater template. A binding value is the ORIGIN'S, and it is spliced into a request
    # gori then sends: `Rules#substitute` writes it into `Authorization: <value>`, so
    # `abc\r\nX-Admin: true` becomes two header lines and `abc\r\n\r\nGET /...` forges a whole
    # second request onto a pooled keep-alive upstream. `rules.cr` already reasons about a
    # binding value being re-interpreted downstream — that is what `escape_backrefs` is for —
    # and covers `gsub`'s replacement grammar only; the message boundary is the other half.
    #
    # ## Why it is asked at the INJECTION SITE and not at extraction
    #
    # Refusing at extraction was the first answer and it was too wide. `Env.expand_bindings`
    # states that "injecting a token into a body is a designed case (a `Replace` rule with
    # `part: Body`, an operator's Repeater template)", and CR/LF in a BODY forges nothing — a
    # PEM block, a SAML assertion, a formatted JSON sub-document are all legitimate values for
    # exactly that case. So the value is bound either way and the refusal lives where the
    # boundary exists: the head half of a message, and any short field that lands on the
    # request line. `Env.expand_bindings` splits the message and applies it to the head only;
    # `Rules#substitute` applies it for the head ops and the head part.
    #
    # A BYTE scan and not a Regex: a header value or a `position` slice can carry bytes that
    # are not valid UTF-8, and Crystal's Regex raises `ArgumentError` on such a subject — which
    # would turn this guard into an exception on exactly the input it exists to stop.

    #
    # The value itself SURVIVES in `@values` (see `refresh`): toggling a rule off and back on

    # keeps the Bindings pane showing a disabled rule's value while nothing resolves it.
    #
    # SLOT-AWARE, and this is the read half of "the active slot is the send context":
    # `$SESSION` means one thing in a request and the send context decides which session that
    # is. With no slot active (the default, and `as-captured`) this is the global table alone,
    # byte for byte the answer this method gave before slots existed.
    #
    # OWNERSHIP, not shadowing — this is what it used to get wrong, and `rows` had it right
    # all along. A name belongs to exactly one table per context, chosen by who CLAIMS it:
    #
    #   * claimed by the context slot  → that slot's table, and nothing else
    #   * claimed by some OTHER slot   → nothing; the value is another identity's
    #   * claimed by nobody            → the global table
    #
    # Writing the slot table OVER the global one instead broke the feature in both directions,
    # measured:
    #
    #   * an operator who bound `$SESSION` globally BEFORE creating the slots that claim it
    #     left a value in `@values` that no later write can replace (`bind` sends a claimed
    #     name to its slot's table, `candidates` never runs a claimed rule unclaimed). Both
    #     `admin` and `user` then resolved that one retired token — one credential wearing
    #     several names, which is the exact failure `Env.expand_bindings_as` names as the
    #     reason this feature exists, and which the Bindings pane contradicted by painting
    #     both rows UNBOUND.
    #   * an operator who takes a name BACK — edits the slot down to a pure header overlay —
    #     left the slot's retired value shadowing the global table forever. A fresh global
    #     rebind could never be seen while that slot was the context, so the wire kept
    #     carrying the identity the operator had just dissolved.

    # `report_unbound_overlay` FIRST, and it is not a gate: with nothing bound, `$SESSION` in

    # `Repeater::Sender` does in slice 1. There is no per-rule "decode" flag, and that is the
    # answer to the decision the design left open:
    #
    #   * **The two surfaces must not disagree.** The same `TokenLoc` on the same response has
    #     to mean one thing whether a Repeater send or the proxy saw it. A per-rule flag would
    #     make one descriptor mean two things depending on which observer got there first,
    #     which is the drift the design forbade. Here both call the same function.
    #   * **`Position` has no text-only reading at all.** `body[100...140]` over a gzip stream
    #     is forty bytes of DEFLATE. "Document body extraction as text-only" is not a narrower
    #     feature, it is a broken one for two of the five kinds.
    #   * **A flag would re-open the failure class this epic exists to close.** The operator
    #     writes `regex /csrf_token=([a-f0-9]+)/`, the page is gzipped, and the rule silently
    #     never fires unless they also find a checkbox they had no reason to suspect. That is
    #     #488/#489/#491/#493 with an extra step.
    #
    # And the hot-path cost the design was right to ask about is gated in TWO stages, neither
    # of which is a flag:
    #
    #   1. `extracts_body_for_host?` — a lock-free atomic first. No body-scoped rule anywhere
    #      means ClientConn never buffers a response body at all, so nothing is decoded
    #      because nothing is held.
    #   2. the rule's own host glob and `InterceptFilter` condition, evaluated BEFORE any decode
    #      (see the `candidates` call below). This is the structural difference from a
    #      Match&Replace body rule, whose `gsub` runs on EVERY response for a matching host: an
    #      extract descriptor runs only on the responses the operator's condition SELECTS. A
    #      `path:/login AND status:200` rule decodes one response per login, not one per
    #      subresource, and the condition is an opt-in the operator already had to write.
