      # Critical triaged for business context at its 3.5 technical score, while the same
      # result ships `level: error` and `rank: 100` beside it. GitHub reads this property for
      # the alert's severity, so the two would contradict each other on one alert. A 9.8
      # vector still outranks a bare Critical's 9.0 floor, which is the point of carrying the
      # score at all.
      #
      # SUPPRESSED results are excluded from the live half, because GitHub applies this badge
      # PER ALERT, not just in the rules list: a Critical the operator triaged to false-positive
      # was otherwise stamping 9.0 onto the one remaining open Info alert that happened to share
      # its title. When every result for a rule is suppressed there is no live severity to show,

      #     cookie, and its `Expires` date carries a comma of its own. ", " presented two cookies

      #     can hold, so every boundary is recoverable — and when there is more than one they
      #     also ride, one array element per field, in the message's `gori/setCookie` property.
