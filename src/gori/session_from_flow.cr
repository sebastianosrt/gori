module Gori
  # One captured login flow → one session slot's header overlay.
  #
  # Carrying a session into `gori run` was a three-step playbook: write an extract rule for
  # the token, write a Match & Replace that splices `$SESSION` into the outgoing request, and
  # remember `--bind-from FLOW` on every sweep — because a binding VALUE is memory-only and
  # dies with the process. That is the right machinery for a token that ROTATES, and it stays
  # exactly where it was.
  #
  # It is not what the common case needs. The common case is a login response that sets a
  # cookie or hands back a bearer token which then stays valid for the afternoon, and for that
  # the honest primitive is the one gori already has: a `SessionSlot` whose `set_headers` are
  # LITERAL bytes, saved with the project, applied by `--slot NAME` on every later send.
  # This module is the reader that turns the one into the other, so an operator types one
  # command instead of three.
  #
  # ## What it reads, and in what order
  #
  # The RESPONSE is the authority — it is the message that minted the session:
  #
  #   1. every `Set-Cookie` `name=value` (attributes dropped) folded into one `Cookie:` line,
  #      in wire order, last value winning for a repeated name;
  #   2. the response's own `Authorization`, if it carries one;
  #   3. else a `access_token` / `token` / `id_token` STRING at the TOP LEVEL of a JSON body,
  #      as `Authorization: Bearer <value>`. Three key names and a `JSON.parse` — deliberately
  #      not a JSONPath expression, because the moment this grows a path language it is a
  #      worse `create_extract_rule` rather than a shortcut. An operator whose token lives
  #      somewhere else writes the extract rule, which is the surface for it.
  #
  # Only when the response offers none of those three does the REQUEST's own `Authorization`
  # come across — the credential that was already in play (a Basic exchange, an API key). It
  # is last on purpose: a refresh flow whose request carries the STALE bearer and whose
  # response body carries the fresh one must copy the fresh one.
  #
  # ## Provenance
  #
  # Every value here is the ORIGIN'S bytes, not the operator's. `SessionSlot.overlay_head`
  # writes a set-header value VERBATIM and says why: an overlay an operator typed is the
  # operator's own bytes. That reasoning does not reach this path, so a CR/LF/NUL is REFUSED
  # here rather than spliced into every request the slot later overlays — the same guard, and
  # the same predicate (`Bindings.boundary_forging?`), that a bound value passes at the send
  # seam. See `Bindings.boundary_forging?`.
