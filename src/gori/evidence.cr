module Gori
  # Frozen issue evidence (#1038): the exact bytes that proved a finding at a point in time,
  # taken FROM a mutable workbench object and kept where nothing on the workbench can reach
  # them again.
  #
  # Tags and Collections say how a session is organised, entity links say what is RELATED to
  # an issue, a retest says how to run the check again — and none of those keeps the
  # material the same. A linked Repeater tab's next send replaces its response; a linked
  # History flow is one retention sweep from gone; a stale link keeps the reference and
  # loses the bytes. This module builds the copy (`Snapshot`) from either live source, and
  # `Store#freeze_evidence` writes it in one transaction with the link.
  #
  # The copy carries its own provenance — source kind and id, the moment it was taken, and
  # a SHA-256 of what was stored — so a report can say what it was handed even after the
  # source is gone. Nothing here resolves back through the source.
  module Evidence
    # Ceiling on what one project's frozen evidence may hold, summed over `bytes`. Bodies
    # are already capture-capped per flow, so this bounds the COUNT of large snapshots, not
    # any one of them; `Store#freeze_evidence` refuses past it rather than evicting — an
    # eviction would be a retention sweep over the one table that exists to be exempt.
    QUOTA_BYTES = 256_i64 * 1024 * 1024

    # Above this a freeze is CONFIRMED with its byte cost shown, below it the copy just
    # happens. Most exchanges are a few KiB and asking about each would train the operator
    # to answer without reading; a multi-MiB download is the case the question is for.
    LARGE_BYTES = 1_i64 * 1024 * 1024

    # What a freeze writes — every fact the row keeps, computed ONCE here so the store, the
    # confirm dialog ("this will cost 3.2MB") and the toast all describe the same copy.
    #
    # `request_head`/`response_head` are the heads AS THE SOURCE HOLDS THEM, bodies likewise
    # (still chunked/compressed, P7); the viewer decodes for display the way every other pane
    # does. For a captured flow that is the wire form. For a Repeater tab it is the tab's
    # SAVED request — `$KEY` bindings unexpanded, no Authorize-slot overlay, exactly what
    # `repeaters.request` holds, because the tab keeps no request-as-sent — beside the last
    # response the store holds for it. The hashes cover these stored bytes.

    # labelled as evidence of a response that never happened is exactly the misleading
    # artefact this feature exists to prevent. The caller says so and leaves the tab alone.
    #
    # Two facts about that pairing, both consequences of the `repeaters` row's shape and
    # named in the docs: the TUI and CLI persist a response only for a SUCCESSFUL send, so
    # after a failed re-send the copy carries the last good response (the pane shows the
    # error, the row does not); and the request is the tab's CURRENT saved text, so a request
    # edited since that send freezes beside the response of the earlier one.
    #
    # The second of those is the one case that breaks the feature's own promise — one
    # exchange — so it is DETECTED rather than only documented (#1038). `response_request_sha256`
    # (Schema V28) is the digest of the request that produced the stored outcome; when it is
    # present and disagrees with the request the row holds now, `request_drifted` is set and
    # every surface says so before writing a copy.
    #
    # Computed past the never-sent guard, so it covers an ERRORED send as well as a response:
    # "these bytes could not be delivered" is a claim about the request that was sent, and an
    # edit since makes it as wrong as a mispaired 200 would be.
    #
    # A NULL digest leaves it FALSE. That is a response persisted before V28 (or by a gori
    # that did not record it), and "not recorded" is not evidence of a mismatch — an unknown
