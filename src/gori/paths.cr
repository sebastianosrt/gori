    # `~/.gori` was 0755 = world-traversable, exposing world-readable project DBs
    # underneath). 0700 has no group/other bits for any umask to strip, so
    # `mkdir_p(mode)` yields it exactly; the explicit chmod additionally tightens a
    # pre-existing 0755 dir from an older install. Mirrors cert_authority.cr locking

    # `tighten: false` keeps the 0700 creation but skips the chmod on a directory that was
    # ALREADY there. The distinction is ownership, not mode: a directory gori makes is gori's
    # to lock down, one it merely FINDS belongs to whoever made it. Every caller but one names
    # a path inside GORI_HOME, where the two are the same thing — but `gori --config PATH`
    # takes an arbitrary path, and its parent can be a shared checkout, a dotfiles repo, or
    # (for a relative `--config`) the working directory. Silently stripping group/other off
