module Gori
  # Where a stored flow CAME FROM — which gori tool put the request on the wire, through which
  # surface, and (when the tool has one) which of its sessions.
  #
  # History is read as evidence, and until this existed six different producers wrote into
  # `flows` with nothing on the row telling them apart: the capture proxy, MCP `send_request`
  # (whose `record_history` defaults to TRUE), a Discover crawl (on by default), an opt-in
  # `--record-history` fuzz sweep or repeater send, and `import`. A response gori's own Repeater
  # elicited and a response the target's client really received were byte-identical here, which
  # is the same class of problem `short_circuited` (the PROTO column's `STUB`) was added to fix
  # one layer down — except that one is about a response gori FABRICATED, and this one is about
  # a request gori SENT.
  #
  # This module is the single source of truth for the History SRC column's label, the value the
  # QL `src:` filter accepts, and the token on disk — the same contract `Gori::Proto` keeps for
  # the PROTO column. `Proto` gets it for free because its label and its filter value are the
  # same string; here they are NOT (the column has five cells and `repeater` does not fit), so
  # `parse?` accepts BOTH spellings and a spec pins the two tables against the enum. Someone who
  # reads `RPTR` off the screen and types `src:rptr` must get the rows they just looked at.
  module FlowSource
    # The tool that produced the flow. Stored as `#token` in `flows.source` (TEXT).
    #
    # TEXT and not the integer enum value (`FlowState`'s storage), because this vocabulary is
    # open-ended in a way a lifecycle is not — every workbench that learns to record adds a
    # member — and a token keeps a `sqlite3` dump, a HAR comment and an MCP payload readable
    # without a lookup table. It also survives a reordering of the enum, which an integer does
    # not.

      # An issue's retest (#1036) replaying its Repeater steps in order. Its own member and
      # not `Repeater`, because the two answer different questions about the SAME bytes: a
      # `repeater` row is a request an operator drove by hand, a `retest` row is one step of
      # a check gori ran to decide whether a finding is still there. A report reads the
      # difference, and `source_ref` carries `issue #N step M` so the row names WHICH check.
      Retest
      # A session slot's refresh (#1233) replaying its Repeater steps to re-authenticate the
      # slot — by hand, or on its own before a send when the slot's policy said the token was
      # about to expire. Its own member because it is traffic an operator may never have typed
      # at that moment, and "log freely" is the half of the rule that makes that acceptable:
      # `source_ref` carries `slot NAME step N`.
      Refresh
      # A Fuzzer or Miner run's request-time macro (#1350): a saved Repeater session replayed
      # before a candidate to mint a fresh CSRF token or nonce. Its own member for the reason
      # `Refresh` is — it is traffic nobody typed at that moment, so it has to be
      # distinguishable — and not `Refresh`, because the two answer different questions: a
      # `refresh` row re-authenticates a SLOT, a `macro` row belongs to one RUN and is sent as
      # the slot that is active for it, overlay included. `source_ref` carries `macro step N`.

      # Read out of a file someone else captured (HAR, Burp, `--urls`, an OpenAPI document).

      # Does the surface that produced this flow ALREADY run its own explicit passive scan on
      # the very same send?
      #
      # This is NOT `sent_by_gori?`, and the difference is the whole point. `Probe::Analyzer`'s
      # passive feed must skip a flow only when skipping it loses NOTHING — i.e. when some
      # surface hands the identical response to `scan_detail` by hand. Filtering the feed on
      # "gori sent it" instead switched passive scanning OFF for five workbenches that have no
      # such call, so a Discover crawl produced zero passive findings: no leaked secret, no
      # missing security header, no `Alt-Svc` h3 notice, no cookie-flag finding, across the
      # whole crawl.
      #
      # Every `true` below is backed by a real call site, and adding one here without adding the
      # call is how the coverage hole comes back:
      #
      #   Repeater — TUI `RepeaterController#probe_scan_repeater` (HTTP and WS) and MCP
      #              `send_request`'s `probe_scan_saved_repeater`. `Repeater` is also the kind
      #              MCP `send_request` records under (the SURFACE column is what separates an
      #              agent's send from the operator's), so both of its producers are covered.
      #   Fuzzer   — TUI `FuzzerController#probe_scan_fuzz_result`, which mirrors the Repeater's
      #              path so a URL only ever visited through the Fuzzer still surfaces findings.
      #
      # Everything else is `false` because a `grep` for `scan_detail` / `Passive.analyze` finds
      # NO caller for it. `Proxy` never had one (it is the feed's whole reason to exist) and
      # `Import` never sent anything at all; `Discover`, `Miner`, `Sequencer`, `Authorize` and
      # `Probe` record flows — or will, the moment they learn to — with nothing else scanning
      # them, so the feed is their ONLY passive coverage.
      #
      # The residue this does not claim to cover, deliberately, because each is a pre-existing
      # narrowness of the explicit call rather than something the feed guard created: the TUI
      # Fuzzer's scan needs the result's bytes retained (`keep_bodies`), and MCP `send_request`
      # only scans when `save` persists a Repeater row. Both under-scan a little; neither
      # double-counts, which is what this predicate exists to prevent.
