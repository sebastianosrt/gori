module Gori
  # User-defined History columns (#819) — the model shared by the TUI list, the column editor,
  # `gori run history --column` and MCP `list_history`.
  #
  # A column is an EXTRACT DESCRIPTOR the list draws. QL already answers "which flows match";
  # nothing answered "what is the value of X in each row" — an `X-Request-Id`, a JWT `sub`, a
  # rate-limit header, a JSON field. The machinery to pull those out of a message has existed
  # since session bindings (#501); until now its output only ever fed Bindings, never the eye.
  #
  # ## What this module is NOT
  #
  # It is not a second extraction grammar (P3). Every value here comes out of
  # `Gori::TokenExtract` through the same `TokenLoc` an extract rule carries, so a column and a
  # binding reading `header:x-request-id` off the same flow cannot disagree. What this adds is
  # the two axes a DISPLAYED value needs and a bound one does not: an order, and a side.
  #
  # It is also not a projection over the store (P8). Values are computed for the rows a caller
  # is about to draw or print, from bytes it reads for exactly those rows — never precomputed,
  # never indexed, never stored. `Prepared#values` takes one already-loaded `FlowDetail`; the
  # decision of which flows to load is the caller's, and every caller makes it per screenful or
  # per printed page.
  module DisplayColumns
    # The cell width a column with no explicit width gets, and the bounds an explicit one is
    # clamped to. 12 fits a short id, a rate-limit count or a truncated token; the operator
    # widens the ones that need it.

    # How many columns one project may define. Every column takes cells from HOST and PATH —
    # the two that answer "what request is this" — so the ceiling is not arbitrary hygiene: past
    # a handful the list stops being a list of requests. Eight is already more than any terminal
    # under ~200 columns can draw.
    MAX_COLUMNS = 8

    # How many body bytes a body-scoped column reads per row.
    #
    # `Cookie`/`Header` read the head alone and cost nothing; `Regex`/`JsonPath`/`Position` need
    # the decoded entity, and a screenful of 50 rows with an uncapped read is 50 multi-MiB BLOBs
    # pulled out of SQLite per frame. The cap is generous enough that an ordinary JSON API
    # response is whole (a truncated body fails to parse and the cell goes blank — which is the
    # honest answer, since the value may well have been past the cut), and the exact bytes are
    # always one `↵` away in the detail pane.
