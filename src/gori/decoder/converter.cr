  # (gzip, hash digests, base64/hex decode) stay first-class; text converters are
  # authored with the `text` builder, which wraps the lossless Bytes⇄String
  # round-trip (the same invariant mcp/serialize relies on). Depends on Gori::Error, the
  # stdlib, and the two leaf FFI codecs (`Proxy::Codec::Brotli`/`Zstd`) — the two
  # `Content-Encoding`s a captured body arrives in that Crystal has no stdlib reader for.

    # it never escapes a `run`.
