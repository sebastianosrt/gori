  # The global named-chain library (settings.json `decoder.chains`) rendered as CONVERTERS,
  # so a saved name is a chain step like any built-in: `myenc > url-encode` runs wherever a
  # spec is accepted — the Decoder tab, the Repeater/Fuzzer `§value¦chain§` marker, `gori run
  # decoder`, MCP `decode`. Registering into the registry rather than teaching `run` a second
  # kind of token is what buys that reach: every surface already resolves a step through
  # `Registry#[]?`, and the ^Y autocomplete already feeds off `Registry#match`.
  #
  # Settings pushes the entries in (Decoder.library=); the engine never reads settings itself.

    # Ceiling on ONE saved chain's flattened step count. Splicing is exponential in the worst

    # Why `name` can never work as a saved chain's name, or nil when it can. ONE rule, asked
    # by every surface that admits a name — the tab's ^S prompt, the settings.json parse, and
    # this registrar — because a saved chain is CALLABLE as a step, so a name no spec could
    # ever spell as one token saves an entry that silently does nothing:
    #   - blank after strip: `Registry.normalize` folds it to "", which nothing resolves;
    #   - a chain separator (or a Fuzzer marker char) inside: `parse_spec` splits it in two;
    #   - an `exec:` prefix: `Decoder.run`, `flatten` and the pre-send gates all test
    #     `exec_step?` BEFORE the registry, so the token spawns argv `mytool` with the
    #     operator's privileges instead of ever reaching the chain it named.

      # entries 0..i-1 answered `r[tok]?` and every BACKWARD reference stayed a run-time nested

      # seconds of CPU for one `run decoder`, and 2.8 s for three fuzz requests at depth 18.
