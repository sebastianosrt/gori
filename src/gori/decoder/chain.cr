  # blocking it for up to `hooks.timeout_secs` each time, with a half-typed argv. That is the

  # louder because this preview is inside the draw call rather than beside it. Such a step is
  # withheld instead and the pane says so. The default is TRUE: every other caller — the

  # is looking at the PIPELINE pane, and silently carrying the input forward as if the step had
  # run would hand them a value that is not what the chain says it is. A `Failed` row with the
