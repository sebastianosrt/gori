module Gori::Decoder
  # Readers for the four NATIVE-SERIALIZATION formats a web target hands its own client and
  # expects back: Java `ObjectOutputStream`, ASP.NET ViewState (`ObjectStateFormatter`), PHP
  # `serialize()`, and Python `pickle`. gori already DETECTS them — `Probe::Passive::
  # SerializedObject` flags the magic in a cookie, a parameter or a hidden field and names the
  # deserialization surface — and until now that was the end of the answer: the operator was
  # left holding an opaque base64 string (#1011).
  #
  # ## The same projection `BinaryDocument` already defines
  #
  # Each reader is a **reader → labelled tree**, rendered as JSON text and carrying a
  # `BinaryDocument::Rendering` so the caller can ask the one question that matters — is this
  # rendering ABOUT this body, or is it what a schema-less reader made of bytes that were never
  # this format? A tree that is wrong is worse than a hex dump that is right, and `describes?`
  # is where that is enforced, exactly as it is for MessagePack and CBOR.
  #
  # What JSON cannot hold comes back NAMED rather than folded away: `{"$ref": …}` for a
  # back-reference, `{"$bin": …}` for opaque bytes, `{"$partial": …}` where the walk stopped.
  # The same accepted ambiguity comes with it — a document whose own key is literally `$ref`
  # renders the shape a wrapper does — and the raw bytes stay the truth throughout (P7).
  #
  # ## Read-only, and never execute
  #
  # These decode. They do not re-encode (a faithful Java/.NET serializer is not worth writing
  # here and an edited graph is not what the operator came for) and they emphatically do not
  # RUN anything: the pickle reader is a *disassembler*, in the shape of `pickletools.dis`, and
  # a `REDUCE` is a line of output rather than a call.
  #
  # ## Back-references are emitted, never inlined
  #
  # Java `TC_REFERENCE` and PHP `r:`/`R:` both name a value already in the stream, and each
  # comes back as `{"$ref": …}`. Expanding one turns a small body into exponential output — the
  # same blow-up `Msgpack::MAX_JSON_BYTES` documents — and it is also the LESS faithful
  # rendering: a shared reference is a fact about the graph. Pickle's memo `GET` is the same
  # idea and does NOT wear that marker, because the pickle reader is a disassembler rather
  # than a tree builder: a `BINGET` is an opcode record whose `arg` is the memo key.
