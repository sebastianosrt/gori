module Gori
  # Hands a captured RESPONSE BODY to the desktop — the terminal's way out of not having a
  # renderer. The operator picks a flow and gets the real thing in a real viewer: an HTML page
  # laid out, a PNG on screen, a PDF paginated, a 4 MB JSON in something that can fold it.
  #
  # Burp ships this ("Show response in browser") from inside a GUI that ALREADY renders; a
  # terminal proxy needs it more, not less, and gori had no path to it at all — `browser.cr`
  # launches a proxied browser to GENERATE traffic, which is the opposite direction.
  #
  # Split like `ExternalEditor`: everything here is pure (decode, name, write, prune) and the
  # spawn lives in the Runner, which owns the terminal. Nothing in this module runs a process.
  #
  # ## What it writes, and what it deliberately does not
  #
  # The DECODED body (P7's display rule — `ContentDecode`), because a `file://` URL carries no
  # `Content-Encoding` and a browser handed gzip bytes shows garbage. The body ALONE: headers
  # are already on screen in the pane the operator invoked this from, and "render" means the
  # document, not the exchange.
  #
  # No `<base href>` injection. It would make an HTML page's relative `<script>`/`<link>`
  # resolve to the live origin — a nicer render, bought with requests to the target that the
  # operator did not ask for and cannot see (P4). So a page whose assets are relative renders
  # unstyled, and that is the honest trade: this shows you what the RESPONSE said, not what the
  # site looks like. Point the proxied browser at the URL when you want the latter.
  #
  # ## The extension is ours, never the target's
  #
  # The suffix comes from a fixed allowlist keyed on the response's own media type, and an
  # unrecognised type falls to `.txt`/`.bin`. The file NAME is built from the flow id and a
  # timestamp. No byte of either comes from the response, so a hostile `Content-Type` (or a
  # filename in a `Content-Disposition` this module never reads) cannot pick the extension the
  # desktop will dispatch on.
  #
  # Opening a target's HTML in a browser runs the target's JavaScript, from a `file://` origin
  # that cannot reach the target's cookies. That is the same bargain Burp's version makes and
  # it is the operator's to make — the verb is explicit, and the status line says the page is
  # live. gori does not strip scripts: a neutered render is a different document from the one
  # under test, which is the whole thing this is for.
  module ExternalOpen
    # Where previews land: gori-owned, 0700 (`Paths.ensure_dir`), and swept by `prune`. Under
    # GORI_HOME rather than the system temp dir so the files are findable when a viewer wants
    # a path typed at it, and so a wipe of GORI_HOME takes them with it.
    def self.dir : String

    # How many preview files to keep. A sweep runs on every write, so the directory is bounded
    # by USE rather than by a cleanup nobody remembers to run. Generous enough that the file
    # from ten flows ago is still openable from a viewer's recent list.
    KEEP = 32

    # Cap on what is written out. `ContentDecode`'s own bomb ceiling already bounds the inflate;
    # this bounds the WRITE, so a legitimately huge body cannot fill a home directory because
    # someone pressed a key. A truncated preview still renders — HTML and JSON both degrade
    # readably — and `Result#truncated` lets the caller say so.
    #
    # Equal to `ContentDecode::MAX_OUT` on purpose (this is the same ceiling seen from the
    # other side), which used to make `truncated` unreachable for a compressed body: the
    # inflate stopped AT the ceiling and `size > MAX_BYTES` was then false by one byte. The
    # native decoders answer that by overshooting their cap by up to one buffer (see
    # `Brotli.decode_full`) — but `ContentDecode` now trims its own return back to `max_out`,
    # so `cut` can no longer fire on a DECODED body at all. `decode_full`'s `complete` reports
    # that cut instead (the same trim sets it false), which is why `truncated` below reads
    # three sources rather than this one. `cut` still covers the undecoded fallback, where
    # `bytes` is the stored body and can exceed this ceiling on its own.
    MAX_BYTES = 32 * 1024 * 1024

    # What the caller shows and what the Runner spawns against.
    #
    # `truncated` is "this file is NOT the whole document", from any of the three ways that
    # happens: the capture cap cut the stored body before it reached us (`body_truncated`, the
    # default 2 MiB `DEFAULT_CAPTURE_MAX_MIB` makes this the ordinary case, not an edge one),
    # the decompressor never reached end-of-stream, or `MAX_BYTES` cut the write. All three
    # produce a partial file that renders, so all three are one flag — the caller says
    # "(truncated)" and the operator knows not to read the tail as the document's end.
