  # Output ceiling for any single step / decompression drain — lifted from
  # Proxy::Codec::ContentDecode::MAX_OUT (32 MiB) so a chained decompress can't bomb.
  MAX_OUT = 32 * 1024 * 1024

  # The marker that turns a chain step into an EXTERNAL COMMAND (#818):
  # `base64-decode > exec:./mytool --flag > json-pretty`. Everything after the colon is the
  # argv, tokenized by `ProcessHook.parse_argv` and exec'd with NO SHELL.
  #
  # Why `exec:` and not the `| argv` the issue drew. `|` is already one of this grammar's three
  # interchangeable SEPARATORS (`SEPARATORS`, documented in the CLI reference), so `a > | ./tool`
  # splits into a bare `./tool` token with the marker gone before anything can read it — and
  # repurposing `|` would silently change what every existing `a | b` chain means, from "then run
  # converter b" to "then exec the program b". A colon-prefixed kind marker is the idiom already
  # in the tree (`DisplayColumns`: `header:x`, `regex:…`, `position:…`), collides with no
  # separator, and survives a shell's own quoting rules unremarkably.
  #
  # LIMIT, and it comes from the same place: the spec is split on `>`, `|` and `,` BEFORE a step
  # is looked at, so those three characters cannot appear anywhere in an exec step's argv. There
  # is no shell here, so redirection and pipelines were never meanings they could carry; an
  # argument that genuinely needs a comma has to be passed some other way (a file, an env var).
  EXEC_PREFIX = "exec:"

  # The argv text of an exec step, or nil when this token is an ordinary converter name. The one
  # place the marker is recognised — the chain executor, the autocomplete panes, the Fuzzer and
  # Repeater pre-send gates and the saved-chain flattener all ask HERE rather than each spelling
  # the prefix out (P1).
  # A bare `exec:` (or `exec:` with only whitespace after it) IS an exec step — an empty one.
  # Requiring a non-empty remainder sent it to the registry instead, which reported `unknown
  # converter "exec:"` and pointed the operator at a converter name that was never the problem;
  # it also re-opened the completion popup over a marker they had just typed. The step now fails
  # with `no command`, which is what is actually wrong with it.

  # Whether this token names an exec step at all (however broken its argv is). Separated from
  # `exec_spec` because the callers that REFUSE a bad chain need "this was meant to be an exec
  # step" to be true even when the argv does not tokenize — otherwise a typo'd command falls
  # through to the registry and is reported as an unknown converter, which sends the operator
  # looking for a converter name.

  #
  # A saved chain is why this cannot be a scan for the marker: the library registers each saved
