  # The terminal UI, built directly on termisu's cell buffer. termisu provides

    # Construct the terminal, turning the "no controlling terminal" failure into a clean
    # message instead of a raw backtrace. Termisu opens /dev/tty directly (independent of
    # STDIN/STDOUT redirection), and raises when there is none — CI, or a detached /
    # background job. `hint` tails the message with how to run interactively. Every
    # interactive entrypoint (the TUI and `gori wizard`) goes through here so the guard
    # lives at the one shared construction point.

    # Crystal's default `::Log` backend is `Log::IOBackend.new`, whose io is **STDOUT** — which
    # under a TUI is the screen being drawn. termisu emits three INFO records inside
    # `Termisu.new` alone, and it used to hide that by seizing the root binding for its own file
    # (see `with_termisu_logging_silenced`). Taking that away without putting gori's binding in
    # its place painted those records into the first frame: measured, `gori tutorial` opened
    # with "Initializing Termisu v0.6.1" written across its own tour chrome. `App#run_tui` had
    # always bound first and was fine; `gori wizard` and `gori tutorial` reach a terminal
    # without ever calling it, which is why the binding belongs at the SHARED construction
    # point rather than in one caller.
    #
    # The io is memoized and the binding re-applied on every call: three entrypoints share one
    # fd, and a caller that re-asserts after something else has had its say (App#run_tui does)
    # costs nothing.

    # `Termisu.new` unconditionally runs `Termisu::Logging.setup`, and with nothing in the
    # environment that opens `/tmp/termisu.log` in append mode and rebinds the process-wide root
    # logger to it at DEBUG. Three things follow from that, none of them gori's intent:
    #
    #   - a path in a world-writable directory is opened BY NAME on every launch, and
    #     `File.open(path, "a")` follows a symlink. On a shared box anyone can pre-create
    #     `/tmp/termisu.log` pointing at a file this user can write and collect gori's records
    #     there. gori keeps its own tree at 0700/0600 to avoid exactly this shape.
    #   - the file is world-readable and never rotated, and every launch appends the terminal
    #     setup trace to it — measured, ~10 lines per run — so it doubles as an unowned record
    #     that this user runs gori, growing without bound.
    #   - `::Log.setup("*", …)` CLEARS prior bindings, so it would drop what `bind_log_file`
    #     just installed.
    #
    # `TERMISU_LOG_LEVEL=none` is termisu's own switch for all three: it marks logging
    # configured and returns BEFORE opening the file or touching `::Log`.
    #
    # SET AND RESTORED around the call rather than left in place. `ENV[]=` is `setenv(3)` for
    # the whole process, and Crystal hands the parent environment to every child by default —
    # so leaving it set exports gori's preference to the statusline's `sh -c`, to `$EDITOR`,
    # and to the external process hooks (#818). A user debugging a termisu app from inside gori
    # would have had its logging silenced with nothing to point at. An operator who set the
    # variable themselves keeps their setting untouched: termisu's records then land in
    # gori.log, since `bind_log_file` above ran first and termisu's `Log.setup` re-points the
    # root at its own file only when it actually configures one.
