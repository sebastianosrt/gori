  # The History row-colour lens: which captured rows get painted, in what colour, in which
  # style. DISPLAY ONLY — nothing here reaches the proxy, and this object is deliberately NOT
  # passed to `Proxy::Server` / `Tls::Tunnel` / `build_listener`. A colour rule paints a row
  # that has already been captured, so an over-broad one costs an operator a misleading list,
  # never a modified message.
  #
  # Shaped like `Rules` on purpose — same two-scope model (a global library in settings.json,
  # this project's rows in SQLite, and this project's per-rule DISAGREEMENTS with the library
  # as an override map), same `{id, scope}` identity, same "did the write commit" answers — so
  # an operator who knows the Rewriter tab already knows this one.
  #
  # The one axis where the two genuinely differ: rewrite rules COMPOSE (every enabled rule runs,
  # in order) while colour rules RESOLVE (the FIRST enabled match paints the row and the rest
  # are never consulted). Order is therefore the operator's precedence statement, which is why
  # reordering is a first-class action on the TUI, the CLI and MCP alike.
  #
  # ── the two tiers, and why a colour rule speaks full QL ─────────────────────────────────
  # A colour rule's condition is a HISTORY QL string — the same grammar, the same field set and
  # the same answers as the filter bar above the list it paints. That is a deliberate reversal
  # of what this file used to say ("Not a new dialect, and NOT QL: … there is no query to run
  # when the row is already in hand on the render path"), and the reversal is narrow: for
  # `host:`/`status:`/`proto:` there is still no query to run, and none is run. The old statement
  # was wrong only about the fields the ROW PROJECTION cannot answer — `body:`, `header:`,
  # `size:`, `dur:`, `url:` — where there is a query to run, it is bounded by the screenful of
  # ids being painted, and the alternative was what shipped: `body:` parsing fine, painting
  # nothing, and saying so only in a note.
  #
  # So `compile` sorts each rule into one of two tiers, and the tier is a property of the rule,
  # never of the row:
  #
  #   ROW tier — every term answerable from a `FlowRow` (see `ROW_FIELDS`). Matched in memory by
  #     `InterceptFilter`, exactly as before, with no store access at all.
  #   STORE tier — anything else. Compiled by `QL.parse(…, fts: false)` and answered by one
  #     `Store#ids_matching` over the ids being painted.
  #
  # `scope:` belongs to the STORE tier for a reason one step removed from the others: the rules
  # are not in the row OR in the bytes, they are the PROJECT's. The tier split gets that right for
  # free — `ROW_FIELDS` subtracts from `InterceptFilter::FIELDS`, and this backend refuses `scope:`
  # by name (it has no scope to consult, see there) — so a `scope:` condition falls to the store,
  # where `compile` threads the project's lens (`Scope.ql_lens`) into `QL.parse`. The lens is
  # re-read on every `refresh` that a scope-naming rule is live for, so adding a scope rule
  # repaints the list on the next poll rather than leaving a stale boundary painted.
  #
  # The tiers cover DISJOINT rule sets, so the two matchers can never disagree about one rule;
  # for the fields they both implement (`host` `path` `method` `scheme` `status` `proto`, and
  # bare free text over method/host/target) they already agree term for term.
  #
  # ── performance contract ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  # `match` runs on the History RENDER path, once per visible row per frame. So:
  #
  #   * `InterceptFilter.new` / `QL.parse` run ONLY in `refresh` — once per rule per edit/reload.
  #     Neither may appear on the render path; `spec/colormarker_spec.cr` pins this.
  #   * `active?` gates everything: a project with no enabled rule pays one atomic read per row.
  #   * the `Subject` is built once per row and reused across the whole compiled walk, and
  #     `proto` is passed IN because History's row loop already computes it.
  #   * zero allocation is NOT claimed — `InterceptFilter::Term` downcases the subject for its
  #     substring fields. The budget is O(visible rows × rules until first match) short-string
  #     downcases per frame, which is why first-match-wins short-circuiting is load-bearing
  #     rather than cosmetic.
  #   * `needs_store?` is the STORE tier's version of that gate, and it is what keeps this change
  #     free for everyone who did not ask for it: with no store-tier rule the render path is
  #     byte-identical to what it was, down to the absent `@sql_hits` lookup. With one, History
  #     calls `prefetch` ONCE per frame for the whole visible window (one query per store-tier
  #     rule, not per row) and every `match` after it reads a memo.
  class Colormarker
    # A rule with its condition already parsed, into whichever tier claims it: `filter` for the
    # ROW tier, `sql` for the STORE tier, exactly one of them non-nil. Same contract, same

    # of stall per screen, on the list a proxy scrolls all day. At 64 KiB the same screenful is

    # The fields a `FlowRow` answers on its own — the ROW tier's vocabulary, and the whole of it.
    # `InterceptFilter::FIELDS` minus the CONTENT ones: a hold gate fills `Subject#head`/`#payload`
    # with the bytes it has, and a captured row has neither, so `header:` and `body:` belong to
    # the STORE tier however simple the rest of the condition is.
    #
    # Derived by SUBTRACTING rather than listed out, and that is load-bearing: written as a
    # literal list this would silently go stale the next time `InterceptFilter` learns a field.
    # It already did once — `header:` was added to that list and instantly became "row-answerable",
    # so a `header:` rule compiled into the ROW tier and matched a Subject whose `head` is nil.
    #
    # `scope:` is out of it the same way, one indirection along: it is not in
    # `InterceptFilter::FIELDS` because that backend has no project scope to consult (it refuses
    # the name outright — see `InterceptFilter::UNSUPPORTED_FIELDS`), so the subtraction leaves it
    # out and a `scope:` rule lands on the store tier, which threads the real lens. That is the
    # same indirection the paragraph above says already broke once, so `colormarker_spec` pins the
    # tier a `scope:` rule compiles into rather than trusting the derivation to stay true.
    ROW_FIELDS = InterceptFilter::FIELDS - QL::CONTENT_FIELDS

    # Can `match` answer this condition from the row projection alone? Drives the tier split in

    # (both backends free-text over method/host/target and agree), and a `~` term never is,
    # because only QL implements the regex operator.
    #
    # A `proto:` value naming a TRANSPORT (`https`/`wss`/`grpcs`/`sses`) is the one exception
    # a field name alone cannot express: `InterceptFilter` has one field per leaf and
    # `Proto::Kind.parse?` deliberately does not fold the transport away (proto.cr:43-48,
    # because folding it would WIDEN a hold gate to cleartext), so such a term can never be
    # true there — `proto:wss` paints nothing and `-proto:wss` paints EVERYTHING. `QL.proto_cond`
    # already answers it exactly, so the term falls to the store tier.

    # Why this condition cannot be used, or nil if it can.
    #
    # `InterceptFilter.new` NEVER raises — an unknown field degrades to free text and
    # `FilterAst` is total — so there is no parse failure to lean on and every refusal has to be
    # made explicitly. Three of them, and each is a rule that would otherwise fail SILENTLY:
    #
    #   1. an empty condition, and 2. one that folds to match-all (a mid-typed `host:` — a term
    #      with an empty value is DROPPED, and an emptied query matches everything), both paint
    #      every row in History;
    #   3. a `field:` QL does not implement (`hsot:`, or a literal colon in a value) — both
    #      compilers free-text the whole token, so `hsot:evil.com` becomes a literal substring
    #      search over method/host/target and the rule never fires, with no error anywhere;
    #   4. a `~` pattern that does not compile. QL turns one into a never-match clause on purpose
    #      (see `QL.invalid_regex_terms`), which for a QUERY is a result an operator can see is
    #      empty — but for a RULE it is a colour that never appears, and nothing to look at;
    #   5. a term QL would DROP — a bad numeric or an unknown enum value (`size:>bogus`,
    #      `proto:zzz`). This one arrived WITH the store tier: while `size:` was an unknown field
    #      the whole condition was refused by (3), and the moment it became a real field
    #      `host:acme size:>bogus` started compiling to `host:acme` alone and painting every acme
    #      row. That is the silent-BROADEN direction — the one `QL.body_cond`'s own comment calls
    #      the dangerous one — and a query gets to survive it (the operator sees a too-long list
