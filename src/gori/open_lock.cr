  # Advisory "a process has this DATABASE open" lock — a SHARED flock every `Store.open` takes
  # and every `Store#close` releases. Many holders coexist (that is what shared means: two TUIs,
  # a TUI plus an MCP server, a short-lived count), and an EXCLUSIVE acquire fails while any of
  # them is alive, which is the one question a destructive project operation has to answer.
  #
  # WHY IT IS NOT THE CAPTURE LOCK. `CaptureLock` answers "who is the capturer", and it must:
  # exactly one instance listens, and a second one opens view-only. `delete` used to ask THAT
  # question, and its comment states the harm precisely — "rm_rf would unlink the db out from
  # under the capturer, which would then keep 'successfully' writing flows into a now-pathless
  # inode — a silent, total loss of everything captured after the delete". The harm has nothing
  # to do with capturing, though. An MCP server takes no capture lock and writes issues, notes,
  # repeaters and fuzz history all the same, so one MCP server could delete the project another
  # was serving: reproduced with two servers, where the second kept answering
  # `{"id":2,"message":"Note created successfully"}` and reading its notes back while nothing
  # existed on disk. The lock this file adds is the question that was actually being asked.
  #
  # Keyed on the DATABASE, CANONICALIZED (`Paths.canonical_file`) — no legacy per-directory form
  # to preserve, unlike `Project#capture_lock_path`. Canonical because the two sides reach this
  # from different spellings of one path: the registry builds `db_path` from `$GORI_HOME` as it
  # was given, while `gori --db` takes whatever the operator typed. `$GORI_HOME` through a
  # symlink (a dotfiles-managed home, `/tmp` on macOS) would otherwise give one database two
  # lock files, and a probe against the wrong one answers "nobody has it open".
  #
  # BEST EFFORT with ONE carve-out. A project directory that cannot be written yields no lock
  # rather than a failed open, a filesystem whose flock does not work yields no lock, and a
  # destructive caller that could not lock anything proceeds rather than being blocked forever:
  # all of those degrade to the behaviour that existed before this class. The carve-out is a live
  # EXCLUSIVE holder that is STILL there after `try_shared`'s whole retry budget — see the raise
  # there. Opening past that one is not a degradation, it is the specific loss this class exists
  # to stop (a database being VACUUMed or rm_rf'd, with nothing announcing us to the process
  # doing it), so it is the one failure that becomes a sentence instead of a silent open. Same
  # flock caveats as `CaptureLock`: advisory, and a no-op on some network filesystems.

    # How long `try_shared` keeps trying before it refuses, and how long it waits between
    # attempts.
    #
    # An exclusive holder is only ever a destructive operation's guard — but "brief" was wrong
    # about how long those hold it. `Store::Compact` holds it across the strip AND the VACUUM,
    # which is upwards of a second on a mid-size project, and `ProjectRegistry#delete` holds it
    # across an `rm_rf`. Six attempts 3 ms apart is ~18 ms, so an open landing anywhere inside a
    # compact gave up essentially every time — and gave up by returning nil, which used to mean
    # the store opened with nothing announcing it. Reproduced: an INSERT that committed
    # "successfully" into a project directory that no longer existed.
    #
    # Two seconds of short sleeps, because an open is not the capture hot path — nothing is
    # proxied yet, no flow is waiting on this fiber, and the surfaces that call it (a project
    # switch, `gori mcp` binding a project, a delete's dry-run count) can all afford a pause that
    # a typical compact finishes inside of. Bounded rather than blocking, so a pathological VACUUM
    # ends in a sentence the operator can act on rather than a hang with no output.
