  # Global, persisted user settings — the editable runtime CONFIG for one gori

  # tool defaults, rules and integrations. Persisted as JSON at

  # Settings UI edits these class properties and calls `save`. `upstream_proxy` is
  # read live by Upstream.dial, so changing it applies immediately; `bind_host`/
  # `bind_port` are applied by App on the next project open (the live proxy keeps
  # its current bind).
  #
  # The module body is split across src/gori/settings/*.cr, each reopening
  # `module Gori::Settings` with one section's class_property declarations plus its
  # parse_*/serialize_*/save_* helpers (see each file's header comment for its
  # section). This file keeps only the orchestration shared by every section: path
  # resolution, load, save, the 3-way merge-with-disk, the top-level serialize
  # dispatcher, and the couple of generic JSON-parsing helpers (load_bool/
  # normalize_os) reused across sections.
  module Settings
    # THIS process's own serialization of the state it last read from (or wrote to) disk;

    # concurrent writer's unrelated edit isn't clobbered by this process persisting one
    # unrelated field.

    # SERIALIZATION, not the raw file text, and that distinction is the whole guarantee.

    # (`listeners` entries omitting the defaulted `"mode"`, a key gori does not know, a
    # `target_port: 0` gori drops). Such a section then reads as "this process changed it",
    # so gori WINS the merge and a hand edit made in between is silently deleted. That is

    # Which is why the file's own bytes gate the work. The overwhelmingly common tick is one
    # where nobody touched settings.json at all, and for that one there is nothing to fold: the

    # present in the document).
    #
    # ONE reader for both doors. `export` runs it over the document it is about to write and
    # `import` over the document it is about to apply, so the count an operator sees when they
    # ship a profile is the count the next operator sees when they receive it. #818 built this
    # alarm and wired it to one door — a PEER's `pipe` rule (`PeerNotices`, `RuleSetChange`) —
    # on the argument that adopting one means this process will fork and exec a command with
    # the operator's privileges and none of that is visible in any pane. Every word of that
    # applies to an imported profile; this is the second door.
    #
    # Built on the SAME tolerant parsers `apply_sections` uses, never on a walk of the raw
    # JSON. An entry those parsers DROP (a rewriter rule with no pattern, a header op on a body
    # part, a scan rule with no title) never reaches the settings and must not be reported as
    # armed; an entry they CLAMP (`"op": "PIPE"`, `"op": "nonsense"`) has to be reported the
    # way the import will read it rather than the way the file spells it. A hand-rolled walk
    # would be a second description of the parse, free to drift from it — and the drift would
    # be silent in the direction that matters.
    #
    # A command that could never RUN is not reported: an empty argv is refused by
    # `Rules.pipe_argv_error` and fails a Decoder step with "no command", so counting one
    # toward the import refusal would block an import over an entry that arms nothing.
    #
    # WHY THIS REPORTS RATHER THAN EXCLUDES, i.e. why these sections are not in
    # SECRET_SECTIONS. Secrecy is a property of a SECTION: `env` holds token values however it
    # is filled in, so a section-granular default-off is the right shape for it. Execution is a
    # property of a VALUE. A `rewriter` section is usually a handful of ordinary header
    # rewrites and an `editor` is usually `nvim`, so excluding those sections would drop them
    # from every profile that has no hook in it at all in order to catch the one that does —
    # and drop them with no message, since `export_document` says nothing about what it omits.
    # A profile that quietly loses what it was made to carry is its own failure. So the section

    # is written.
    #
    # The first list exists because the caller must be able to report the SAME set the real run
    # reports. Printing only the differing subset made `--dry-run` and the actual import
    # disagree on the count for identical input — "would apply 1 section(s)", then "imported 6"

    # NOT listed is guaranteed to be, which is what "no changes" has to mean to be worth
    # anything. Narrowing it further would need per-section merge semantics restated here (they

    # WHAT "SECTION" MEANS HERE, precisely — this was documented as a whole-section REPLACE,
    # which is only true of the table-shaped sections:
    #
    #   * A section ABSENT from the profile (or not selected) is untouched. This is the real
    #     guarantee, and the one an operator is choosing between when they pass --sections.
    #   * A LIST/TABLE section present in the profile replaces wholesale — upstream_rules,
    #     outbound_tls, listeners, scan_rules, hostname_overrides, tabs, … A profile carrying
    #     `"upstream_rules": []` therefore clears the table, which is how "no rules" is said.
    #   * An OBJECT-of-scalars section (network, editor, probe) applies KEY BY KEY: a key the
    #     profile omits keeps its current value. That is deliberate — a team profile pinning
    #     `network.upstream_proxy` must not also reset everyone's bind_port to the factory
    #     default it never mentioned — but it does mean such a section is merged, not replaced.
    #
    # The second consequence to know: `export_document` omits a section sitting at its factory
    # default (serialize_* skip it), so exporting from a machine where a value is default and
    # importing onto one where it is not will NOT reset it. A profile is a set of values to
    # apply, not a snapshot of a whole configuration.
    #
    # Reuses `apply_sections`, the same reader `load` uses, so every section's tolerant parse
    # (unknown enum → safe fallback, junk entry dropped) applies here identically. Persisting
    # goes through `save`, NOT a raw write: that keeps the atomic temp+rename and the 3-way
    # merge, so an import cannot clobber a concurrent instance's edit to a section it did not
    # touch.
    # A key gori does not recognise is dropped here rather than passed through to
    # `apply_sections` (which would ignore it anyway) — so the "unrecognised section(s) ignored"
    # `import_preview` reports is TRUE. The caller printed a summary derived by subtracting one
    # list from the other, which was wrong in both directions once `document_keys` decided what
    # "recognised" meant.
    #
    # Returns the sections HANDED to `apply_sections`, which is not quite the same as the ones
    # that took effect: the per-section parsers are tolerant by design, so a section whose value
    # is the wrong shape (`"editor": "nvim"` — the #594 guard) is a no-op and still appears here.
    # Narrowing this to "actually changed something" is not available cheaply: re-serializing

    # An imported profile NEVER changes this install's token grammar.
    #
    # `env.syntax` is not a preference a profile may carry for someone else: it decides how the
    # tokens already written into THIS install's project databases — env var names, Repeater
    # drafts, rewrite-rule replacements, slot headers — are read, and nothing rewrites them. A
    # teammate's profile exported to share a var table (or a theme) therefore used to reinterpret
    # every token in every project of whoever imported it, in whichever direction their colleague
    # happened to run. The switch is a deliberate, local act: `gori settings env-syntax`, which is
    # what the import's STDERR note points at.
    #
    # Dropped from the DOCUMENT rather than restored after `apply_sections`, so nothing observes
    # the flipped value in between (`Settings.env_syntax=` bumps the highlight revision and
    # re-styles every open editor) and `save` cannot persist it.
    #
    # `Settings.load` from disk still honours the key: that file IS this install's own state.
    #
    # Two more keys have the same shape, so the strip is a table rather than one key:
    #
    #   * `env.prefix` is the other half of how a stored token is SPELLED — `$ENV.KEY` read with a
    #     `@@` prefix is plain text — so a profile carrying it stopped every token in every
    #     project from expanding, and said nothing.
    #   * `redaction.salt` keys every placeholder this install has already written into an
    #     export. Adopting a teammate's broke the correlation between yesterday's artifacts and
    #     today's, which is the one thing `reset_redaction` refuses to do — and the default
    #     export was handing the salt (a secret, see settings/redaction.cr) to whoever got the
    #     profile.
    #   * the id counters of the three rule lists are this install's numbering, and only ever
    #     move forward from what IT has handed out — see `renumber_imported_ids`.
    #   * `update`'s bookkeeping is this install's memory of what it checked and announced: an
    #     exporter's `notified_version` silenced the importer's "update available" notice.
    #   * `fuzzer.recent_wordlists` is this machine's history of absolute paths.

    # Factory reset: every persisted setting back to the value a fresh install ships with,
    # then written to disk. The reverse of `serialize` — and deliberately built as its
    # mirror, one `reset_*` per `serialize_*` in the same order, because "what a factory
    # reset covers" and "what gets written" have to be the SAME list or the reset quietly
    # leaves a section behind. spec/settings/reset_spec.cr greps the two dispatchers below
    # and fails when they diverge.
    #
    # This drops operator DATA as well as preferences — global env var VALUES, the hostname
    # map, OAST provider tokens, saved decoder chains, rewriter/colormarker rules. That is
    # what a factory reset means here (every one of those lives in settings.json, and the
    # only alternative is a reset that lies about its scope), so the surfaces offering it
    # name them in the confirm.
    #
    # NOT covered, because `serialize` does not write them: project overrides
    # (`project_bind_*`, `project_env_vars`) and the `cli_*` invocation overlay. Those belong
    # to the open project and to this process's argv — a settings reset does not speak for
    # either, and clearing them would silently move a pinned listener.
    # What a factory reset actually achieved. Three outcomes, not two, because the two
    # failures are opposites and a caller has to tell them apart: `Refused` touched NOTHING
    # (so re-applying settings live, or saying "reset" at all, would be a lie), while
    # `Applied` cleared memory and only the write failed.
