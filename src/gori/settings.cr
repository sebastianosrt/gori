module Gori
  # Global, persisted user settings — the editable runtime CONFIG for one gori
  # process (the `settings:*` command-palette entries control this). Split into the
  # section files required above: network, editor/display, keymap/hotkeys, tabs,
  # tool defaults, rules and integrations. Persisted as JSON at
  # <config_dir>/settings.json.
  #
  # Loaded once at startup (CLI flags then override the bind in memory); the
  # Settings UI edits these class properties and calls `save`. `upstream_proxy` is
  # read live by Upstream.dial, so changing it applies immediately; `bind_host`/
  # `bind_port` are applied by App on the next project open (the live proxy keeps
  # its current bind).
  #
  # The module body is split across src/gori/settings/*.cr, each reopening
  # `module Gori::Settings` with one section's class_property declarations plus its
  # parse_*/serialize_*/save_* helpers (see each file's header comment for its
  # section). This file keeps only the orchestration shared by every section: path
  # resolution, load, save, the 3-way merge-with-disk, the top-level serialize
  # dispatcher, and the couple of generic JSON-parsing helpers (load_bool/
  # load_bool_h/normalize_os) reused across sections.
  module Settings
    # THIS process's own serialization of the state it last read from (or wrote to) disk;
    # nil = never loaded. It's the 3-way-merge BASE at save time: a top-level section this
    # process didn't change (in-memory == base) yields to whatever is on disk now, so a
    # concurrent writer's unrelated edit isn't clobbered by this process persisting one
    # unrelated field.
    #
    # SERIALIZATION, not the raw file text, and that distinction is the whole guarantee.
    # `mine` is always gori's canonical form, so basing on the operator's raw text makes the
    # test "is my form of this section byte-identical to how they happened to write it?" —
    # which is false for every section written in a valid but non-canonical spelling
    # (`listeners` entries omitting the defaulted `"mode"`, a key gori does not know, a
    # `target_port: 0` gori drops). Such a section then reads as "this process changed it",
    # so gori WINS the merge and a hand edit made in between is silently deleted. That is
    # exactly the clobber `listener_error`'s `among:` comment (settings/listeners.cr) and
    # #508 are written around, reached through the base rather than through a write-back.

    # it is written, with no second list to keep in step.
    #
    # Sections holding SECRETS or machine-local scratch, excluded from an export unless the
    # operator names them explicitly. `env` carries token VALUES; `decoder` now carries only
    # the named chain SPECS (the open sub-tabs moved to each project's store), but a spec can
    # still describe how an engagement's tokens are unwrapped — and the point of an export is
    # that it can be committed or shared, so it stays opt-in.
    # Note `upstream_rules` is deliberately NOT here — it stores only a username and an
    # environment-variable NAME, never a password (see settings/upstream_rules.cr).
    #
    # THIS LIST IS ONE AXIS, AND THERE ARE TWO. Every sentence above reasons about SECRECY —
    # what a profile would leak outward if it were committed or shared. Since #818 a section
    # can also carry an ARGV, and what that leaks is inward: importing it arms a command gori
    # forks with the receiving operator's privileges. `decoder` is on both axes and is here for
    # the first one only; `rewriter` and `scan_rules` are on the second and are deliberately
    # NOT here. The execution axis is `COMMAND_SECTIONS` below, and it is handled by REPORTING
    # rather than by exclusion — see `command_rules` for that argument in full. Adding an
    # exportable section means asking both questions, not this one.
    SECRET_SECTIONS = ["env", "decoder"]

    # Sections that can carry a COMMAND — the second axis. Every settings value gori hands to
    # `Process.new`/`Process.run` lives in one of these, and the list is what both ends of a
    # profile report from. `spec/settings/profile_commands_spec.cr` walks the tree's spawn
    # sites and fails when one is reachable from a section that is not here.

    # carries its own `enabled` in the same section so it self-arms, and it fires on an
    # interval with no proxied traffic needed. Scoping this to "the #818 hook seams" would
    # have gated the three guarded shapes and waved through the unguarded one.

    # present in the document).
    #
    # ONE reader for both doors. `export` runs it over the document it is about to write and
    # `import` over the document it is about to apply, so the count an operator sees when they
    # ship a profile is the count the next operator sees when they receive it. #818 built this
    # alarm and wired it to one door — a PEER's `pipe` rule (`PeerNotices`, `RuleSetChange`) —
    # on the argument that adopting one means this process will fork and exec a command with
    # the operator's privileges and none of that is visible in any pane. Every word of that
    # applies to an imported profile; this is the second door.
    #
    # Built on the SAME tolerant parsers `apply_sections` uses, never on a walk of the raw
    # JSON. An entry those parsers DROP (a rewriter rule with no pattern, a header op on a body
    # part, a scan rule with no title) never reaches the settings and must not be reported as
    # armed; an entry they CLAMP (`"op": "PIPE"`, `"op": "nonsense"`) has to be reported the
    # way the import will read it rather than the way the file spells it. A hand-rolled walk
    # would be a second description of the parse, free to drift from it — and the drift would
    # be silent in the direction that matters.
    #
    # A command that could never RUN is not reported: an empty argv is refused by
    # `Rules.pipe_argv_error` and fails a Decoder step with "no command", so counting one
    # toward the import refusal would block an import over an entry that arms nothing.

    # is filled in, so a section-granular default-off is the right shape for it. Execution is a
    # property of a VALUE. A `rewriter` section is usually a handful of ordinary header
    # rewrites and an `editor` is usually `nvim`, so excluding those sections would drop them
    # from every profile that has no hook in it at all in order to catch the one that does —
    # and drop them with no message, since `export_document` says nothing about what it omits.
    # A profile that quietly loses what it was made to carry is its own failure. So the section

    # The first list exists because the caller must be able to report the SAME set the real run
    # reports. Printing only the differing subset made `--dry-run` and the actual import
    # disagree on the count for identical input — "would apply 1 section(s)", then "imported 6"
    # — and the count is the one thing `--dry-run` is run to learn.

    # NOT listed is guaranteed to be, which is what "no changes" has to mean to be worth
    # anything. Narrowing it further would need per-section merge semantics restated here (they

    # WHAT "SECTION" MEANS HERE, precisely — this was documented as a whole-section REPLACE,
    # which is only true of the table-shaped sections:
    #
    #   * A section ABSENT from the profile (or not selected) is untouched. This is the real
    #     guarantee, and the one an operator is choosing between when they pass --sections.
    #   * A LIST/TABLE section present in the profile replaces wholesale — upstream_rules,
    #     outbound_tls, listeners, scan_rules, hostname_overrides, tabs, … A profile carrying
    #     `"upstream_rules": []` therefore clears the table, which is how "no rules" is said.
    #   * An OBJECT-of-scalars section (network, editor, probe) applies KEY BY KEY: a key the
    #     profile omits keeps its current value. That is deliberate — a team profile pinning
    #     `network.upstream_proxy` must not also reset everyone's bind_port to the factory
    #     default it never mentioned — but it does mean such a section is merged, not replaced.
    #
    # The second consequence to know: `export_document` omits a section sitting at its factory
    # default (serialize_* skip it), so exporting from a machine where a value is default and
    # importing onto one where it is not will NOT reset it. A profile is a set of values to
    # apply, not a snapshot of a whole configuration.
    #
    # Reuses `apply_sections`, the same reader `load` uses, so every section's tolerant parse
    # (unknown enum → safe fallback, junk entry dropped) applies here identically. Persisting
    # goes through `save`, NOT a raw write: that keeps the atomic temp+rename and the 3-way
    # merge, so an import cannot clobber a concurrent instance's edit to a section it did not
    # touch.
    # A key gori does not recognise is dropped here rather than passed through to
    # `apply_sections` (which would ignore it anyway) — so the "unrecognised section(s) ignored"

    # reset covers" and "what gets written" have to be the SAME list or the reset quietly
    # leaves a section behind. spec/settings/reset_spec.cr greps the two dispatchers below
    # and fails when they diverge.
    #
    # This drops operator DATA as well as preferences — global env var VALUES, the hostname
    # map, OAST provider tokens, saved decoder chains, rewriter/colormarker rules. That is
    # what a factory reset means here (every one of those lives in settings.json, and the
    # only alternative is a reset that lies about its scope), so the surfaces offering it
    # name them in the confirm.
    #
    # NOT covered, because `serialize` does not write them: project overrides
    # (`project_bind_*`, `project_env_vars`) and the `cli_*` invocation overlay. Those belong
    # to the open project and to this process's argv — a settings reset does not speak for
    # either, and clearing them would silently move a pinned listener.
    # What a factory reset actually achieved. Three outcomes, not two, because the two
    # failures are opposites and a caller has to tell them apart: `Refused` touched NOTHING
    # (so re-applying settings live, or saying "reset" at all, would be a lie), while
    # `Applied` cleared memory and only the write failed.
