module Gori
  # A **view** is a named History query applied as a LENS: it ANDs over whatever is in the
  # filter bar rather than replacing it, exactly the way the `s` scope lens does. That is the
  # whole point of the feature (#776) — `src:proxy` stops being a query the operator retypes
  # every session and becomes a mode that survives the next `/`.
  #
  # Three scopes, one record:
  #
  #   * BUILTIN — shipped in code, present in every project, never editable (`BUILTINS`).
  #   * GLOBAL  — settings.json `saved_views.views`, reusable across every project.
  #   * PROJECT — this project's `saved_views` table (schema V18).
  #
  # `merged` folds all three into the runtime list the picker renders and the CLI/MCP resolve
  # names against. The two-scope halves are modelled on `Probe.custom_rules` and
  # `Oast.provider_configs` — same duality, same `"#{scope[0]}_#{id}"` key — and deliberately
  # NOT on `Colormarker.merged`, which additionally carries a per-project enable-override map.
  # A view has no enabled state for a project to disagree about: it is either the one you
  # picked or it is not.
  #
  # There is likewise no `position`/`move`. Colour rules need ordering because order IS their
  # meaning (the first enabled match paints the row); views RESOLVE BY PICK, so order is
  # display-only and is derived here instead of stored.
  module SavedViews
    # The project's active view, as a `View#key`. Lives in the project DB rather than

    # Two axes, deliberately kept apart. The SOURCE views answer "is this evidence about the

    # imported socket would be lying about its own name, and the axes compose for free anyway:
    # a view ANDs over the filter bar, so `History + Repeater` plus a typed `proto:ws` is the
    # intersection without either built-in having to anticipate the other.
    #
    # `History` is `src:proxy` and NOT `-src:gori`: those are different sets. An imported flow
    # is neither traffic gori observed nor traffic gori sent (see `QL.src_cond`), so the
    # negative spelling would quietly pull somebody else's capture into "History".
