      gori QL filters captured HTTP flows:

        host:example.com status:>=500 method:POST   # AND is implicit (whitespace)
        host:api AND status:5xx                     # ...and can also be spelled out
        host:api OR status:5xx                      # OR
        (host:a OR host:b) -method:GET              # parentheses group
        NOT (host:cdn OR host:static)               # NOT negates a term or a group
        -(host:cdn OR host:static)                  # so do `-(` and `NOT(` fused to the paren
        host:"my host"  "two words"                 # quotes keep spaces in one term
        -host:cdn login                             # negation + free-text search

      AND/OR/NOT are recognised UPPERCASE and unquoted, so searching for the words
      and/or/not still works; quote them ("AND") to force a literal. Precedence is
      NOT > AND > OR. `-term` and `NOT term` are equivalent.

      Fields (use : for value match, ~ for regex):
        host path method scheme proto status size reqsize respsize dur header body url stub static src scope cache

      Sides: header: and body: search the REQUEST AND THE RESPONSE. Prefix either with `req.` or
      `resp.` to search one side — req.body:token resp.header:set-cookie resp.body~secret\\d+ —
      and negate as usual (-resp.body:abcd). `res.` is accepted as a synonym of `resp.`, and
      req.size/resp.size are synonyms of reqsize/respsize. Fields that only ever have one side
      (host, method, status, …) take no prefix.

      Comparisons (status size reqsize respsize dur):
        status:>=500  size:>10000  dur:>=500  dur:<2s  (dur defaults to ms; suffix ms|s)

      Status class shorthand: status:5xx  status:4xx

      Protocol: proto:ws  proto:grpc  proto:sse  proto:http  (ws = the 101 upgrade or an accepted
      RFC 8441 extended CONNECT; grpc/sse by Content-Type)

      Short-circuited: stub:true  stub:false  — flows gori answered ITSELF from a Match&Replace
      short-circuit rule, with NO origin involved. Their response bytes came from the rule, not
      from the server, so `stub:false` is what you want before treating History as evidence.

      Static assets: static:true  static:false  — images, fonts and audio/video, judged by the
      response Content-Type (image/svg+xml is NOT static: it can carry script) and, when a row has
      no Content-Type (a 304, a pending flow), by the path's extension before `?`. Only a successful
      fetch is static (2xx or 304): an error, a redirect or a flow with no response never is. JS,
      CSS, source maps, JSON, archives, PDFs, octet-stream, HLS playlists and an image fetched
      through a URL parameter (`/_next/image?url=…`, an image proxy) stay visible. Decided once,
      when the flow is captured. `-static:true` hides the noise — the TUI's hide-static lens,
      `--hide-static` and list_history/list_sitemap/list_params `hide_static` are that term.

      Source: src:proxy  src:repeater  src:fuzzer  src:import  …  src:gori — where the flow came
      from. `proxy` is traffic a client sent through gori; every other value is a request gori
      itself put on the wire (`src:gori` is all of them at once), and `import` is a capture read
      out of somebody else's file. The SRC column's short tags are accepted too (src:rptr).
      CAUTION: a flow captured before gori recorded provenance matches NEITHER direction — see
      the caveat list.

      Scope: scope:in  scope:out  — the project's scope rules (the include/exclude boundary the
      TUI's `s` lens and `--in-scope` apply), as an ordinary term: it negates and it groups.
      INDEPENDENT of whether that lens is switched on, because a filter term is a question, not
      a mode. With NO scope rules configured nothing is in scope, so `scope:in` AND `scope:out`
      both match nothing — the question is not asked rather than answered "everything". Note
      that makes `-scope:in` (which matches everything, like any negated never-match) different
      from `scope:out` in that one state; ql_explain says when a project has no scope rules. On
      a surface with no project scope at all the term is DROPPED like a bad numeric, and
      ql_explain / strict:true name it.

      Cache: cache:hit  cache:miss  cache:dynamic  cache:none  — what the RESPONSE HEADERS say
      about caching, normalised to one signal. `hit` = served from a shared cache (a positive
      `Age`, `X-Cache: HIT`, a served-from `CF-Cache-Status`) — the web-cache-deception
      candidate; `miss` = a cache saw it but went to origin (`X-Cache: MISS`,
      `CF-Cache-Status: MISS`, `X-Cache-Hits: 0`); `dynamic` = declared uncacheable
      (`CF-Cache-Status: DYNAMIC`, `Cache-Control: no-store`, a bare `private`); `none` = no
      cache verdict — no cache headers, or only neutral ones (`Age: 0`, a field-limited
      `private="set-cookie"`, a vendor value gori does not recognise); a Pending flow is
      `none`. Read from the stored head on read, so it names what the wire said, not what a
      cache did — confirm a `hit` with a no-session re-request. An unknown value (cache:yes)
      drops the term.

      Regex (~): host~^api\\.  body~secret\\d+  path~/admin  method~^P(OST|UT)$ — on host path url
      method scheme header body (and req./resp. header/body). Case-sensitive; prefix (?i) to fold.
      A `~` on any OTHER field QL has (status size dur proto stub src scope …) is DROPPED and
      reported like a bad numeric, not searched as text; a `~` on a name QL does not have at all
      is free text, the whole token.

      body: SEARCHES AN INDEX, AND THE INDEX IS BOUNDED. `body:` reads a trigram index that
      covers only the FIRST 8 KiB of each side (request and response), and a body is not
      indexed at all when its Content-Type is binary or its Content-Encoding is compressed.
      So `body:` can return NOTHING for content that is genuinely there — deep in a large
      body, or in a gzipped/binary one. `body~regex` scans the stored bytes instead, with no
      cap and no content-type rule, so it is the one to reach for when `body:` comes back
      empty and you expected a hit. (`body:` is the fast path; `body~` is the more complete one.)

      NEITHER READS A COMPRESSED BODY. gori stores the WIRE form (DESIGN.md P7) and decompresses
      only at display time, so `body:` skips a gzip/br/zstd body at index time and `body~` regexes
      the compressed bytes. Most real response bodies are compressed, which matters most under
      NEGATION: `-body:secret` and `-body~secret` both KEEP every compressed response, so a query
      that comes back "clean" has not actually looked. Decode-aware matching lives on the Probe
      custom rules (side/region + Content-Encoding decode), not here.
      A COLOUR RULE's `body:` is the complete one: a rule has to paint the row that just
      arrived, and the index lags capture, so create_color_rule scans the bytes instead. Same
      language, one deliberate difference — a colour rule can paint what this query misses.

      Free text (no field:): matches method, host, or target (case-insensitive substring).

      Invalid syntax (e.g. status:>=foo with no numeric value) is rejected — it does NOT match all flows.
      A mixed query (host:beta status:>=foo) silently drops only the bad comparison/field terms and
      applies the rest (a dropped term BROADENS the result). A dropped term is treated as if it were
      never typed, so inside NOT(...) or OR it can SHIFT what the query matches — e.g.
      `NOT (host:x AND size:>bogus)` becomes `NOT host:x` (excludes host x), not match-all. Note the
      further asymmetry with regex: an invalid `~` pattern is a HARD ERROR, not dropped — because a bad
      regex would otherwise silently match NOTHING (indistinguishable from a genuinely empty result),
      so it must be fixed or removed. Use strict:true (or ql_explain) to see exactly which terms were
      dropped before relying on results.

    # is often SECONDS old, and a colour that arrives whenever the indexer catches up is worse than
    # one computed the slow way. The scan reads the same bytes `body~` does, so `body:` here is
    # `body~` with a literal needle: no 8 KiB bound and no text-only rule. See `body_cond`.
    # `body_max` bounds how many BYTES of each side's body a `body:`/`body~` term reads, by
    # compiling the column as `substr(col, 1, N)`. nil (the default) reads all of it. It exists
    # for a caller on an INTERACTIVE path: a body is capped at capture time by
    # `Settings.capture_max` (2 MiB by default, and raisable), so an uncapped scan of one
    # screenful of cap-sized bodies measures ~460 ms — a visible stall, per screen, on the list
    # a proxy scrolls all day. `Rules::RULE_PREVIEW_BODY_MAX` made the identical trade for the
    # Rewriter's preview, and states the identical consequence: a match past the cap is missed.

    # for DIAGNOSIS. `Run.refuse_unknown_query_fields` turns "names a field QL does not implement"
    # into a refusal, and under that cut `gori run history http://acme.test/x` is a query naming
    # the field `http` — so pasting the URL of a request you just watched go by, the commonest
    # search this tool has, aborted with ``unknown query field `http:` ``. The grammar strips
    # quotes before any of this runs, so quoting it was no escape either; `--lenient` was.
    #
    # A KNOWN field is always a field use, whatever its value holds (`body~https?://x` names
    # `body`). For an unknown name, two shapes say it was never meant as one — both read off how
    # QL's own names are spelled rather than guessed:
    #
    #   * a value starting `//`: the token is `scheme://…`, a URL;
    #   * a name that is not an identifier: it must begin with an ASCII letter (so `12:34` — a
    #     timestamp, a port, an IPv6 run — is free text) and hold only letters, digits and `_`,
    #     plus `.` ONLY behind a `SIDES` prefix, since every dotted field QL has is a
    #     `req.`/`resp.`/`res.` one. `acme.test:8443` is an authority; `resp.bdy` is still a typo.
    #   * an UNDOTTED name no field is close to, over a value that is nothing but a PORT (one to
    #     five digits): the token is `host:port` for a host with no dot in it — `localhost:8080`,
    #     `api:3000`, the address of every dev server a proxy ever fronts — and the dot rule above
    #     cannot see it. "Close to" is `suggest_field`'s own tolerance, so a numeric-field typo with
    #     a numeric value (`stauts:500`, `sizee:100`) stays a refused typo with its suggestion
    #     attached. Dotted names never take this road: `resp.status:200` is a namespace guess, and
    #     the SIDES rule already says so.
    #
    # Every typo of a real field passes all of this — `methd`, `hsot`, `resp.bdy`, `xyzzy` are
    # field-shaped, unknown, and still refused, which is the whole point of the refusal.
    # The rule itself now lives in `FilterAst.field_shaped?` — the Issues and Probe bars ask the

    # (every caller and its specs read `QL.field_shaped?`) and supplies the three things that
    # are its own: what it knows, the namespaces it advertises, and its suggester.
    # The `req.`/`resp.`/`res.` prefixes as an ARRAY, built once: `SIDES.each_key` is a

    # ASCII-only table its `lower()` uses — so the `lower(col)` this used to wrap the column
    # in was a second fold of an already-folded comparison, paying a per-row `String`
    # allocation inside SQLite for an answer that could not differ. Dropping it is 2.7x on the
    # scanning filters (`host:`/`path:`/`url:`/a bare word, 9.0ms → 3.3ms over 100k flows;
    # bench/history_filter_bench). `like` still folds the NEEDLE with Crystal's full-Unicode
    # `downcase`, which is why the needle side is decided here at all.
    #
    # For a needle carrying a non-ASCII letter the two never meet: a captured `/Überweisung` was
    # unreachable by `path:` in EVERY spelling, and `InterceptFilter` — the in-memory
    # implementation of this same predicate — matched the row while History did not. Those
    # needles go through `gori_ci_contains` (Crystal's `downcase.includes?` as a UDF), which is
    # the same fix `scope.cr` already applies to a `string` rule.
    #
    # An ASCII needle keeps the native LIKE, because the UDF costs a Crystal callback and two
    # String allocations PER ROW and both forms full-scan either way: measured over 100k flows,
    # `host:` answers in 3ms through LIKE and 71ms through the UDF, and History recompiles this
    # filter on every keystroke (P6 — never stall the data path). Every ASCII character folds
    # identically in the two implementations, so the fast path is exact for the needles that
    # take it. The residue it accepts: a haystack character that folds INTO ASCII under Unicode
    # but not under LIKE's ASCII fold (`İ`→`i`, `K`→`k`, `ſ`→`s`) stays unreachable by an
    # ASCII needle. All three columns are NOT NULL, so the arms cannot disagree under `NOT` the
    # way a NULL haystack would (`NOT (NULL)` drops the row, `NOT (0)` keeps it).

    # :nodoc: — internal, but NOT private: `Store#events_recent` narrows the #124 event feed
    # through this same predicate, so the Activity pane's `/` bar and History's `msg:` agree on
    # what "contains" means and the ASCII fast path above is decided in ONE place. The blank
    # line above is load-bearing: Crystal only honours `:nodoc:` as the FIRST line of the
    # comment block attached to the definition, and the rationale above is its own block.
