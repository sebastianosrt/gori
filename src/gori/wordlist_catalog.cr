module Gori
  # The global wordlist catalog (#1353): named lists that live as plain files under
  # `Paths.wordlists_dir`, so a list saved once is selected BY NAME from the Fuzzer, the Miner,
  # Discover and Cookie cracking, on every surface, from any working directory.
  #
  # The contents stay FILES. Not settings.json and not a project database: a file keeps the
  # global-versus-project boundary (a project never silently inherits another's list — a global
  # name is something the operator typed), reads lazily (`Fuzz::WordlistFile` walks a multi-GB
  # list without materializing it), and is what an operator already drops in that directory by
  # hand. So this module is a NAMING and PLACEMENT layer over the directory and nothing more:
  #
  #   * `resolve` turns whatever a surface was handed (`common.txt`, `./common.txt`, an absolute
  #     path) into the path to open. It is the ONE place that rule lives; every consumer's
  #     loader calls it instead of re-deriving "cwd, then the global directory".
  #   * `list` / `info` / `preview` answer questions about the catalog from `stat` and BOUNDED
  #     reads, never a whole-file scan — a listing runs on the TUI's frame and on MCP's request
  #     path, and a multi-GB list must not cost either one a stall.
  #   * `save_*` / `rename` / `delete` are the only writers: atomic, owner-only, and they refuse
  #     an accidental overwrite (the refusal is decided on the directory entry itself, not on a
  #     check that a concurrent writer could beat).
  #
  # What it deliberately does NOT do is touch a list's bytes. A blank line or a line starting
  # with `#` is a legitimate Fuzzer payload (`Fuzz::WordlistFile` reads every line), while the
  # Miner and Discover read the same two shapes as file formatting (`load`, which only those
  # two call). Both are right for their tool, so the file is the raw source and each consumer
  # keeps its own documented line semantics — normalizing in `resolve` would decide one tool's
  # answer for all of them.
