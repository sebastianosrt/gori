    # Whether this host may take the fast h2 relay at all. FALSE — forcing HTTP/1.1, the
    # ClientConn path — when HTTP/2 is switched off, or a Match&Replace BODY or SHORT-CIRCUIT
    # rule is live FOR THIS HOST, or a session-binding extract rule reads the response BODY for
    # it. Anything else is a candidate, subject to the origin actually speaking h2 (see
    # reflect_origin_h2). Placing the check here also means a downgrade skips the origin ALPN
    # probe entirely: reflect_origin_h2 consults this before dialing.
    #
    # A downgrade is never free, which is why what remains is only what is still REQUIRED.
    # An h2-only client — every gRPC client — cannot take it: a modern grpc-go dies at ALPN
    # enforcement ("missing selected ALPN property") because we no longer offer h2, and an older
    # or hand-rolled one gets one step further and has its preface refused
    # (`conn/client_conn.cr`). So each remaining term is announced once per host (see
    # notice_downgrade); before #492 step 4 this file logged nothing at all.
    #
    # ## What came out, and what each removal had to prove
    #
    # The rewriter gate used to be `active?`, and #492 step 2 NARROWED it rather than removing
    # it: HEAD rules reach h2 now (`H2::HeadRewrite`), but `Rules#active?` is true for a
    # BODY-only rule set too (`rules.cr:48-50` counts any enabled rule regardless of part), and
    # a body rule works today PRECISELY because this gate downgrades — the h1 path is where the
    # buffered-body rewrite lives. Dropping it outright would have regressed body rules from
    # working to silently not working. Body rewriting on h2 is #492 step 5; until then a body
    # rule still earns the downgrade, and only that.
    #
    # The INTERCEPT gate came out in step 3, which made the hold reachable per stream
    # (`H2::StreamGate`). `intercepts_host?` is not consulted by
    # `intercepts_request?`/`intercepts_response?` (`interceptor.cr` — they take their own
    # snapshot), so removing it weakened no gate. What it DID change is that a held h2 message
    # was the head only, because DATA streamed past untouched. PR #6 narrowed that to the
    # bodies the gate cannot buffer (`H2::StreamGate::MAX_HOLD_BODY`); a Match&Replace BODY
    # rule still earns the downgrade, which is what this gate is left deciding.
    #
    # The SANDBOX gate came out in step 4, and it is the one removal that had to answer a
    # different question, because the sandbox is not a seam: an unreachable seam silently does
    # nothing, an unreachable BLOCKING gate lets traffic through. It was reachable only through
    # this downgrade — `ClientConn#handle_request`'s per-request `sandbox_blocks?` — and the
    # relay had no per-request URL check at all. The pre-handshake host gate is no substitute
    # and never was: `sandbox_blocks_host?` deliberately passes a host that MIGHT be in scope,
    # and with any url-level include in the scope that is EVERY host (`host_allowlisted_unlocked?`
    # treats one url rule as "the path might match here"), so path-scoped rules did their whole
    # job per request. Removing the term without replacing it would have made a scope of
    # `https://acme.test/api/*` forward `/admin` to the origin unexamined. It is replaced by a
    # per-stream refusal in `H2::StreamGate` — which also covers something h1 never had to face,
    # a coalesced stream whose `:authority` is not the CONNECT host (§9.1.1).
    #
    # ## What #526 narrowed, and what that costs
    #
    # Both remaining rewriter terms were HOST-BLIND: they read a global atomic count, so ONE
    # rule scoped to `alpha.test` downgraded every h2 host on the proxy, including hosts its
    # own glob can never match. That is the same shape step 2 fixed for head rules — a gate
    # true for something it is not protecting — and it took the same remedy: narrow, don't
    # remove. `rewrites_body_for_host?` / `short_circuits_for_host?` (`rules.cr`) keep the
    # atomic counts as a lock-free fast path and then ask the host glob. An UNSCOPED rule
    # matches every host and still downgrades everything, exactly as before.
    #
    # The cost is a stream whose `:authority` is NOT the CONNECT host (§9.1.1 coalescing):
    # such a stream can now carry a rule this per-connection gate never saw, where the blanket
    # downgrade caught it. gori's leaf certs carry a SAN of exactly the requested host
    # (`cert_builder.cr`), so a conformant client cannot coalesce onto one and the case needs a
    # hand-rolled peer — but it is not impossible, so it is not left silent: `H2::HeadRewrite`
    # already computes the per-stream authority for rule scoping and logs once per connection
    # when a stream's authority differs from this host AND a body/stub rule matches it.
    #
    # Returns the REASON (an `H2Offer` member) rather than a Bool, and nil for a candidate:
    # every one of these branches writes a `gori.log` line, and `ClientConn` has to be able to
    # say which one applied without re-deriving it from a rule table that has since changed.
