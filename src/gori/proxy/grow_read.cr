module Gori::Proxy
  # Reading a frame whose length the PEER declared, without trusting the declaration with
  # memory. An h2 frame header may claim 16 MiB and a WebSocket header 16 MiB (the relays' own
  # caps); allocating that on the header alone let a peer send ten bytes, stall, and hold 16 MiB
  # per connection — about 1 GB for 60 connections, and an OOM kill well inside the 2048
  # connection cap. The buffer now grows with the bytes that arrive, so a stalled frame holds at
  # most four times what it actually sent.
  module GrowRead
    # A frame this size or smaller is read into its final buffer at once, exactly as before:
    # 16 KiB is h2's default SETTINGS_MAX_FRAME_SIZE, so ordinary h2 traffic and nearly every
    # WebSocket frame never take the growing path on the fiber the proxy shares (P6).
    PRESIZE = 16 * 1024

    # A buffer of `prefix` followed by exactly `len` bytes read from `io`, the same contiguous
    # shape the callers forward verbatim. nil when `io` ends first.

          # size rather than ~2×, and a stalled one still holds at most 4× what it sent.
