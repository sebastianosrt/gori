# buffered layer, which pulls a large chunk off the socket into `@in_buffer_rem`; any bytes
# the origin left past the framed body therefore sit in THAT buffer, not on the kernel socket,
# where an fd-level `MSG_PEEK` cannot see them. `peek` would find them but calls `fill_buffer`
# (blocking) when the buffer is empty, which is the common clean-socket case — so it cannot be
# used on the keep-alive fast path. Reading `@in_buffer_rem` directly is the only non-blocking
# answer. The name is long-standing Crystal internals; if it ever changes this fails to compile

    # (Closed). ~0.3µs, so it costs the keep-alive fast path nothing. A TLS socket hides its
    # fd and the residue may sit in OpenSSL's decrypted buffer where a raw peek cannot see it,

    # 2. Ciphertext Crystal's OWN buffered layer already pulled off the fd. `state`
    #    asks the same question of THIS socket's plaintext buffer; this is the different buffer
    #    underneath it, and neither `SSL_pending` nor the peek below can see it.
    #    `OpenSSL::BIO.read_ex` reads through `bio.io.read` — the BUFFERED read — and
    #    `IO::Buffered#read` calls `fill_buffer` whenever the request is under half the buffer,
    #    pulling up to 8 KiB. OpenSSL asks for a 5-byte record header first, so EVERY record
    #    read over-reads. `Socket#initialize` sets only `sync = true`, which is write-side;
    #    read buffering stays on and gori never disables it. So an origin that flushes head and
    #    body as two records leaves record 2 sitting here with `SSL_pending` at 0 (not decrypted
    #    yet) and the fd peek at EAGAIN (kernel buffer already drained) — and without this step
    #    the socket is handed out Clean and the next payload's response is framed against these
    #    leftovers. Pinned by `spec/fuzz/conn_pool_checkout_spec.cr`.
    # 3. Otherwise ask the fd whether ANYTHING is waiting. If the kernel buffer is empty too,
    #    the socket is provably idle and this returns Clean without a read — the common case,
    #    and what removes the ~1.6ms this branch used to cost every checkout.
    # 4. Only when bytes ARE waiting does it fall through to the timed read. That step cannot
    #    be skipped: a peek sees bytes but not what they MEAN. A TLS 1.3 record carrying a
    #    NewSessionTicket has outer content type 0x17, exactly like application data — the real
    #    type is encrypted — so nothing short of letting OpenSSL decrypt it can tell a
    #    post-handshake message from a leftover response. Reading the content-type byte was
