  # Dials origin servers and parses authorities. A dialed upstream is reused across a
  # single client connection's keep-alive requests (see ClientConn#acquire_upstream) and
  # closed when that connection ends; there is no cross-connection pool. When an upstream
  # proxy is configured (Settings), every dial is tunnelled through it via CONNECT (so both
  # TLS-wrapping and plaintext forwarding run unchanged over the tunnel).
  #
  # An `http+tls://` route (Settings::UPSTREAM_TLS_KIND) wraps the hop to the PROXY in TLS
  # first, so the CONNECT line — which names the origin — and the Proxy-Authorization header
  # are written inside that session rather than in the clear. That is why every dial entry
  # point returns `IO?` rather than `TCPSocket?`: the socket handed back may be a TCP socket,
  # a TLS socket to the proxy, or (for an https origin through a TLS proxy) origin TLS nested
  # inside proxy TLS. Everything downstream already reads and writes an `IO`.

    # scope, the passthrough list and History — that is the whole point of #529.

    # wrote; the pin closes a hole where the CLIENT decided. Letting the pin win would make a
    # host override a silent no-op on every transparent connection, which is a worse failure
