module Gori::Proxy::H2
  # One direction's head-rewrite pipeline: buffer a header block, decode it, run the
  # Match&Replace rules over its h1-equivalent text, re-encode, re-frame (#492 step 2).
  #
  # ## Why the forward happens after the rewrite here, and only here
  #
  # `Relay#pump` forwards every frame BEFORE capturing it so a slow writer never delays the
  # peer (P6). Rewriting inverts that for header blocks: nothing can be written until
  # END_HEADERS, the decode, the rules and the re-encode have all happened. That inversion
  # costs nothing, for two reasons that hold only for header blocks:
  #
  #   1. RFC 9113 §6.2/§6.10 — a HEADERS without END_HEADERS may be followed ONLY by
  #      CONTINUATION frames for the same stream. Nothing else is queued behind the buffer,
  #      so there is no head-of-line blocking to create.
  #   2. An h2 receiver cannot act on a partial header block; END_HEADERS is when it could
  #      have started anyway. Holding fragments until then delays the peer by zero.
  #
  # DATA keeps the forward-first path untouched — the body rewrite (#492 step 5) is where
  # that trade actually gets made.
  #
  # ## The one-way latch, and why "re-encode only the heads a rule changed" is unsound
  #
  # HPACK is stateful and per-direction (RFC 7541 §2.2). When the original encoder emits a
  # literal WITH incremental indexing (§6.2.1) it inserts that entry into its own table and
  # the peer's decoder inserts it too — the two stay equal because both act on the same
  # representation. `HPACK::Encoder` with `indexing: false` emits literals WITHOUT indexing,
  # so re-encoding a block drops those inserts on the peer's side while the original
  # encoder's table has already grown. Its next block indexes entry 62 and the peer resolves
  # a different header, silently, or one out of range and the connection dies.
  #
  # That breaks on the FIRST re-encoded head, with indexing off, without this encoder ever
  # emitting a dynamic index. So mixing is not a compression trade, it is a correctness bug,
  # and the invariant is:
  #
  #   once a direction re-encodes one header block, it re-encodes EVERY subsequent header
  #   block in that direction for the rest of the connection — trailers and PUSH_PROMISE
  #   included — and never goes back.
  #
  # The latch engages lazily, on the first head a rule actually changes, so a connection no
  # rule touches stays byte-exact and pays no compression loss. It is one-way for the mirror
  # of the reason above: while we re-encode, the original encoder keeps inserting on its own
  # table and we keep dropping those inserts, so returning to passthrough would forward
  # indices the peer never received.
  #
  # Dynamic-table insertion stays OFF (`Encoder`'s default). Turning it on needs more than
  # this latch — a direction that engaged mid-connection has an empty encoder table where
  # the peer's decoder holds entries from before the switch — and is not part of this step.
  class HeadRewrite
    # Split a re-encoded block at SETTINGS_MAX_FRAME_SIZE's initial value, which is also
    # the floor every endpoint must advertise at or above (RFC 9113 §6.5.2). Every
