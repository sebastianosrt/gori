module Gori::Proxy::H2
  # The bridge between an h2 header block and the HTTP/1.1 head text every other gori
  # surface speaks — the Match&Replace rules included (#492 step 2, decision A).
  #
  # `Rules` operates on head BYTES: it gsubs the whole head as one string and its
  # add/set/remove-header ops split on the head's EOL and skip line 0 as the start line
  # (`rules.cr:246`, `rules.cr:264`). An h2 head has no start line and no `Host:` field, so
  # wiring the rewriter to h2 needs a representation to run the rules against.
  #
  # It is the SYNTHESIZED h1 head, and specifically the one `Assembler` already stores on
  # every h2 flow — because that is the text an operator reads before writing a rule, and
  # the Rewriter tab's "would affect N flows" preview already evaluates rules against
  # exactly those bytes (`rules.cr:331-345` → `detail.request_head`). A field-array-native
  # rewrite path would make the live proxy disagree with its own preview.
  #
  # So `synth_request` / `synth_response` are the single implementation, called from both
  # `Assembler` (capture) and the rewrite path (`HeadRewrite`) — the two cannot drift.
  # `parse_request` / `parse_response` invert them, restoring from the ORIGINAL fields what
  # the h1 text has nowhere to carry: `:scheme`, the §6.2.3 never-indexed markings, and
  # whether the `Host:` line was ours or the peer's.
  #
  # ## The round trip is only sound while it is INJECTIVE (#517)
  #
  # "Invert" holds for a head the text can represent, and NOT for one it cannot: a field value
  # carrying a CRLF comes back as two fields, a duplicate pseudo-header comes back as one, an
  # uppercase name comes back lowercased. Every such input is malformed h2 a conformant peer
  # would REJECT, so the round trip would launder it into a message the far side ACCEPTS —
  # gori promoting the peer's malformed head, a header-injection primitive that exists only
  # because of this bridge. `h1_faithful?` is the precondition that says no; `parse_*` refuse
  # outright rather than trust a caller to ask.

    extend self

    # Synthesized h1-equivalent request head. HTTP/2 carries the target host in the
    # `:authority` pseudo-header (RFC 9113 §8.3.1) rather than a `Host:` field, and the
    # loop below skips ALL pseudo-headers — so without the `Host:` line the head has no
    # host at all, breaking `gori run show` / MCP get_flow / QL `header:host`. Emitted only
    # when the fields carry no explicit (non-pseudo) `host`, which is what makes the
    # mapping reversible: see `parse_request`.
    #
    # `trailers` is `synth_response`'s argument, and it is here for the reason `TRAILER_MARKER`
    # exists at all: a REQUEST trailer block (a gRPC client-streaming call, a `TE: trailers`
    # probe) is merged into the request head by `Assembler#finish_header_block` exactly as a
    # response trailer is, and after the merge it reads like a header the client sent in its
    # head. Whether a target/CDN/WAF treats a trailer as a header is the test the operator came
    # to run, and that question is no less real on the request side. Passed ONLY by the capture
    # projection; the rewrite path re-synthesizes from the live fields and passes nothing, so
    # the fabricated line can never reach an h2 wire.
    #
    # `pushed_by` is the same kind of capture-only line for a request the CLIENT NEVER SENT: a
    # PUSH_PROMISE is the origin inventing a request, and `Assembler#handle_push_promise`
    # projects it as an ordinary flow, so History / QL / the Sitemap handed an operator reading
    # for evidence a row the origin authored, with nothing saying so.
    #
    # `protocol` is the third, and the same discipline again: the loop below skips ALL
    # pseudo-headers, so an RFC 8441 extended CONNECT's `:protocol` — the one field that says
    # a WebSocket is running on this stream — reached no stored byte, and the head read as an
    # ordinary CONNECT tunnel in `gori run show`, HAR and MCP alike. Passed ONLY by the
    # capture projection; the rewrite path re-synthesizes from the live fields and passes
    # nothing, so this line can never reach an h2 wire.
