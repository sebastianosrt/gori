  # The WebSocket transcript of an RFC 8441 extended CONNECT stream (#733).
  #
  # A WebSocket opened over HTTP/2 carries the SAME RFC 6455 frames the HTTP/1.1 Upgrade path
  # carries — §5.1 of RFC 8441 replaces the handshake and nothing else. What it does not carry
  # is a socket: the frames arrive as the payloads of that stream's DATA frames, and a DATA
  # boundary has nothing to do with a WebSocket frame boundary, so a frame straddles two DATA
  # frames as readily as ten frames share one. That is why this is a stream REASSEMBLER fed
  # bytes rather than a per-DATA-frame parser: the parser is `WS.read_header`/`WS.read_body`
  # (the same codec the h1 relay runs — there is no second one), driven over an
  # `IO::Memory` window that keeps whatever a frame still owes and rewinds when a frame is
  # incomplete.
  #
  # ## Capture only, and deliberately so
  #
  # This never writes to a socket and never resizes anything. It runs from `Assembler#feed`,
  # which the h2 relay reaches only AFTER the frame is already on the wire, over a COPY of a
  # payload that has been forwarded — so the h2 flow-control accounting is untouched and no
  # DATA frame changes length. #492 step 5 (a length-CHANGING DATA rewrite) was closed as
  # decided-not-doing precisely because resizing DATA deadlocks against the peer's flow-control
  # window; a per-message hold or a Match & Replace edit on this path would have to do exactly
  # that, so neither is offered here. The advisory on the flow says so rather than half-doing
  # it — see `Assembler#extended_connect_sentence`.
