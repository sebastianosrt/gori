module Gori::Proxy::H2
  # Pure, byte-exact HTTP/2 framing (sans-IO), mirroring the h1 codec's stance:
  # the raw payload bytes ARE the truth (P7); per-type interpretation (HPACK,
  # DATA assembly) is layered above. We never reject unknown frame types — the
  # `type` is kept as a raw octet so extensions/garbage forward verbatim.
  #
  # Wire layout (RFC 7540 §4.1): a 9-octet header
  #   Length (24) | Type (8) | Flags (8) | R (1) + Stream Identifier (31)
  # followed by `Length` payload octets.
  module Frame
    # The client connection preface (RFC 7540 §3.5): sent once, before any frame,
    # right after the h2 ALPN handshake. A SETTINGS frame follows it.
    PREFACE = "PRI * HTTP/2.0\r\n\r\nSM\r\n\r\n".to_slice # 24 octets

    # How few bytes of PREFACE are still enough to decide. Four is `"PRI "` — the method plus its
    # delimiter, which is the discriminating part; below that a buffer holding only `"P"` decides
    # nothing, and `"PR"` still admits `PROPFIND`.
    PREFACE_FLOOR = 4

    # Does this connection open with the HTTP/2 client preface (RFC 9113 §3.4)? nil, or fewer
    # than PREFACE_FLOOR bytes, is not a yes.
    #
    # The FLOOR is the whole point, and it is why this is not a first-byte test. `0x50` also
    # opens `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH` and `PROPFIND`, so a first-byte branch diverts every form
    # submission into the h2 relay, where it dies at `read_preface` with the connection already
    # committed and the origin already dialled. That was true of the LISTENER routing this was
    # written for (`Server#serve_reverse`, `#serve_transparent`) and it is equally true inside a
    # CONNECT tunnel (`ClientConn#handle_connect`) — the assumption that a tunnel carries only a
    # ClientHello or a preface is exactly what #755 refutes. One home, so the two cannot drift.
    #
    # Compares only what the caller HAS: a listener passes the whole `peek` buffer, the CONNECT
    # path passes the four octets it read back. Either way a true answer means the rest of the
    # preface is still ahead of `read_preface`.

    # `16 * 1024 * 1024` (= 1<<24), one MORE than any 24-bit length, so the `len > max_payload`
