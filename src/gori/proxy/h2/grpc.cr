  # length-prefixed messages, and the call status arrives in the response
  # trailers (`grpc-status` / `grpc-message`, captured by the Assembler's trailer
  # merge). Framing lives here; schema-less protobuf decoding of each message
  # body is `Gori::Protobuf` (see `gori run show --format json` → `grpc_messages`).
