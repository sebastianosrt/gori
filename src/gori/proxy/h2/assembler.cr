  # Turns the raw frame stream of one h2 connection into the decoded projection:
  # it assembles HEADERS(+CONTINUATION) and DATA per stream, decodes headers via
  # HPACK, and emits a `flows` row per request/response exchange (so h2 traffic
  # lands in History/QL/Repeater next to h1). The raw frame log remains the truth
  # (P7); this is the derived, human-readable view.
  #
  # One Assembler per connection. Its two HPACK decoders are direction-scoped
  # (each endpoint keeps its own table). Both relay pump fibers call `feed`, so a
  # Mutex serializes the shared stream map — the latency-critical raw forwarding
  # already happened before we are called, so this never delays a peer.
  #
  # v1 scope: a flow is emitted when the REQUEST half-closes (END_STREAM). Long
  # client-streaming / bidi requests therefore surface only once the client ends
  # its half — acceptable for now (the raw frames are always captured live).

    # second dynamic table and is wrong the first time the peer uses an index. So it
    # decodes through `decode_head_block` and hands the RESULT back here.
