  # Ceiling on the refused-stream set (see `@refused`). The set is the only thing standing
  # between a refused request's later DATA and the origin, so past the ceiling the CONNECTION
  # goes — not the memory bound, and not the guarantee. Generous on purpose: it is per
  # connection and only refusals count, so reaching it means thousands of refused streams on
  # one connection, i.e. a client that has ignored thousands of RST_STREAMs.

  # The URL test both refusal gates below make, and the only place the stream's own
  # `:authority` and the connection's host are reconciled. Returns the blocked request's
  # `{scheme, host, target}` — the promise gate needs them for its log line — or nil when the
  # sandbox allows it.
  #
  # ## Why two URLs are tested, not one
  #
  # h1 inside a tunnel tests `scheme://<CONNECT host><target>`: `resolve_forward`
  # short-circuits on the pinned host, so the name in the request and the socket's
  # destination cannot disagree. On h2 they can. RFC 9113 §9.1.1 lets a client REUSE one
  # connection for any origin the certificate covers, so a single relay carries streams whose
  # `:authority` is not the CONNECT host — which is exactly why the head pipeline already
  # scopes rules and holds on the stream's own authority (`head_rewrite.cr`).
  #
  # For a blocking gate, choosing one of the two names is choosing which half to leak. Take a
  # scope of `https://acme.test/*` — a URL rule, so `sandbox_blocks_host?` lets EVERY host
  # past the CONNECT gate and every per-request decision is this one:
  #
  #   * authority only would pass a stream claiming `:authority: acme.test` on a connection
  #     to `evil.test`, i.e. the request goes to a host the scope never allowed.
  #   * connection host only would pass a coalesced stream to `evil.test` riding an
  #     `acme.test` connection, because the URL it tested was the connection's, not the
  #     request's.
  #
  # So both are tested and either refusal is a refusal. "The two differ" is host OR port: a
  # stream claiming `:authority: acme.test:443` on a tunnel CONNECTed to `acme.test:8443` still
  # goes to 8443, and a port-scoped exclude on 8443 has to see that. On an ordinary connection
  # the two are equal and the second test is skipped, so the common path costs one evaluation.

  # The same containment gate for a request the ORIGIN invented (RFC 9113 §8.4 server push).

  # `@ordered` is false, and `HeadRewrite#head_text` returns nil for it (rules are correctly
  # never run over a promised head), so `block.head` is nil too. A promised request therefore
  # walked past a gate that refuses the identical authority on a real request, and
  # `Assembler#handle_push_promise` projected it into History as an ordinary row — a flow the
  # origin authored, indistinguishable from one the client made, inside the evidence the
  # operator came to read. "Hard containment" is what the sandbox advertises.
  #
  # Refusing a promise means three things, and they are the client's own §8.4 disposition:
  #   * the PUSH_PROMISE never reaches the client (suppressed, hence `@heads.latch` — the
  #     third route into the §6.2.1 HPACK asymmetry, exactly as `refuse_locked` describes);
  #   * RST_STREAM(CANCEL) goes to the ORIGIN on the PROMISED id, which is how a client
  #     declines a push, so the origin stops before it sends the pushed response;
  #   * the promised id joins `@refused` on THIS leg, so a pushed response already in flight
  #     is swallowed rather than written to a client that never learned the stream exists.
  #
  # Both URLs are tested for the reason `sandbox_blocked_url` gives: the promised
