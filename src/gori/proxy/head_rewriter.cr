module Gori::Proxy
  # The seam where the Match&Replace lens rewrites messages in flight. Kept abstract
  # (like FlowSink) so ClientConn stays decoupled from the rule engine and testable
  # with a stub. HEAD rewrites (`rewrite_request`/`rewrite_response`) run on every
  # message while its body streams untouched (P6). BODY rewrites are opt-in and cost
  # a buffer: ClientConn only calls `rewrite_request_body`/`rewrite_response_body`
  # (and only after the host-scoped directional predicate says a rule can apply), passing
  # the ENTITY body — de-chunked, decompression left to the impl to skip — and re-frames the
  # message (Content-Length synced) itself. Every rewrite MUST return the SAME bytes
  # when it changes nothing, so the caller can tell a rewrite happened and preserve
  # byte-fidelity (P7) for unmodified flows.
  abstract class HeadRewriter
    # A response the rule engine authored for a request that will NOT be sent (#511).
    #
    # `head` is the status line plus header lines, each CRLF-terminated, WITHOUT the
    # terminating blank line and WITHOUT `Content-Length`/`Transfer-Encoding`: framing is
    # ClientConn's job, because only ClientConn knows the request method (a HEAD or a 204
    # takes no body) and it is the one keeping the connection in sync. A rule that names
    # either header has it dropped here rather than trusted — a stub whose declared length
    # disagrees with the bytes gori sends desyncs the next request on a keep-alive
    # connection, which is a far worse failure than a corrected header.
    #
    # `error` is non-nil only when gori generated this response ITSELF because the rule
    # could not be honoured (an unparseable stub, an unreadable `body_file`). The engine
    # answers anyway rather than falling through to the origin: the operator declared this
    # request contained, and dialing out because a stub file went missing would send a
    # payload they believed was never leaving the machine. The message is recorded on the
    # flow so the failure is visible instead of silent. (A map-local rule that opted into
    # `fallthrough` declines a request whose file is absent — but it does so by returning no
    # stub at all, before anything is answered; see `Rules#claim`.)
    # `status` is carried separately so the framing decision does not have to re-parse the
    # head it is about to frame.
    #
    # `ref` names the rule that answered, as text (`project rule #4 · dir app.js`, #1237), and is
    # recorded on the flow's `source_ref`. Text rather than the id alone: the two rule stores
    # number independently, and a mocked response must stay attributable after the rule that
    # produced it is edited or deleted.
    #
    # `fault` (#1237) means there is NO response: the connection is closed, reset or held
    # instead, and `head`/`body`/`status` are empty. `delay` is waited out before any answer
    # (or fault); `hang` bounds a `Hang` fault. The waits are bounded by the rule's own
    # validation (`Store::RespondArgs::MAX_WAIT_MS`) and by `ClientConn::MAX_HELD_CONNECTIONS`.
