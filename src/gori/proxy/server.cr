    #     the pre-handshake host test in front of it — so h2c here is precisely as gated as the
    #     h2 the listener serves today, and no new hole is opened.
    #   * the three rule gates (`h2c_refusal`) — apply, for the reason they apply on
    #     CONNECT: they live on `ClientConn`'s h1 path, the relay cannot run them, and with the
    #     preface already sent the only honest answers are refuse or lie.
