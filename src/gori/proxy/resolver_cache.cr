module Gori::Proxy
  # A short-lived cache of successful `getaddrinfo` answers for upstream dials, keyed by
  # {host, port}.
  #
  # Why it exists: every new upstream connection resolved its host again, and `getaddrinfo` is
  # a blocking libc call, so it holds the scheduler thread every proxy fiber shares until the
  # runtime hands the thread off (~10 ms). Profiled with reconnecting clients over many hosts
  # it was 14-31% of busy time.
  #
  # Why the TTL is short: gori is a security proxy, and the operator may be testing DNS
  # rebinding, or have just edited /etc/hosts to point a name somewhere else. A cached answer
  # is an answer gori did not ask for, so it may be at most TTL old — long enough to absorb a
  # burst of reconnects to one host, short enough that a changed record is picked up within
  # seconds. It is not the operator's override mechanism either: a host override resolves to
  # an IP literal, which bypasses this cache entirely, so it always applies on the next dial.
  #
  # What it never does:
  # - cache a failed lookup (the exception propagates and nothing is stored), so a name that
  #   starts resolving is seen on the next dial;
  # - keep an answer none of whose addresses would accept a connection: the dialer calls
  #   `forget` then, so failover (a record that moved) re-resolves instead of waiting out TTL;
  # - hold an IP literal, which `getaddrinfo` answers without a lookup anyway.
  #
  # It sits BELOW every scope decision: scope is judged on the host name the request carries
  # (`Outbound.scope_url`) before any dial, so caching the address changes nothing about what
  # is in scope.
