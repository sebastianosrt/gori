  # Brotli (`Content-Encoding: br`) decode for the DISPLAY view, via libbrotlidec
  # (the dominant CDN encoding; Crystal has no stdlib brotli). Linked by default;
  # build with `-Dwithout_native_codecs` on a machine lacking libbrotli/libzstd to
  # skip it (the decoder then reports "not built in" and the raw body is shown).
  module Brotli
    AVAILABLE = {{ !flag?(:without_native_codecs) }}

    # :ditto: — plus whether the stream ENDED cleanly (the decoder reported SUCCESS rather
    # than running out of input or erroring).
    #
    # The flag exists because brotli has no magic number and no framing a caller can check:
    # "produced nothing" is the only other signal, and it means "this was never brotli" and
    # "this is a valid stream of an empty payload" equally. The workbench has to tell those
    # apart; the display path does not care and takes whatever decoded.
    #
    # ## The cap stops one buffer PAST `max_out`, deliberately
    #
    # Stopping at `>= max_out` returned a slice whose size depended on where the decoder's
    # last 64 KiB buffer happened to land, and 32 MiB divides by 64 KiB exactly — so a bomb
    # landed on precisely `max_out` and cleared every consumer's `size > max_out` guard
    # (`Chain.run`'s, `ExternalOpen`'s), which reported Ok for output that had been silently
    # cut. One byte PAST the ceiling is what proves the stream had more to give: a body that
    # decompresses to exactly `max_out` is not a bomb and still reports a clean, complete
    # decode, while a bomb now overshoots by at most one buffer and every over-cap consumer
    # sees it. Same rule, same reason, as `Decoder::Codecs#drain` and `ContentDecode#read_all`.
