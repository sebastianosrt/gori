    # The old code encoded the belief that a chunked body's only content is its chunk DATA:
    # `dechunk` stops at the 0-chunk and the rendered head stops at the blank line BEFORE the
    # body, so a trailer was captured by neither half and vanished from every decoded
    # projection while `Trailer:` was still echoed in the head — which reads as "the origin
    # sent none". For trailer-based header injection, trailer smuggling, and gRPC-over-h1
    # (where `grpc-status` arrives here and IS the call's real status) the trailer is the
    # whole result.
    #
    # They are surfaced AS trailers, never folded into the header list: whether a target
    # treats a trailer as a header is itself the test, so the projection must not decide it.
    # Tolerant like `dechunk` — an unterminated trailer section yields what was recovered.
