# Pure, byte-exact HTTP/1.1 head codec (sans-IO).
#
# `parse_*_head` take the already-delimited head bytes (request-line/status-line
# + headers + CRLFCRLF) and return a message whose `raw_head` *is* the input,
# plus best-effort parsed projections. We never reject malformed input (P7);
# we flag `malformed?` and keep the original octets.
#
# `read_head` is the one IO boundary: it consumes an IO up to and including
# CRLFCRLF and not one octet further — no "over-read" to thread through
# keep-alive loops or the CONNECT->TLS handoff. It takes what the transport's
# read buffer is already holding (`IO#peek`) and consumes exactly the prefix
# that belongs to the head, falling back to a byte at a time for an IO with no
# `peek`; see `consume_peeked` for why the bulk form is worth the scan.

  # that writes `HTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: text/plain\n\nbody` renders fine direct — and

  # close-delimited origin's reply came back "ended before CRLFCRLF" and a keep-alive one hung
  # to the head deadline. The bytes are returned exactly as they arrived (P7); nothing here
  # rewrites an LF. What such a head costs its connection is the caller's to apply
  # (`lf_terminated_head?`): it is framed off the lenient view, so it is never reused.
  #
  # The REQUEST side stays CRLFCRLF-only on purpose. A request's peer is the operator's own

  #
  # ## Why a chunk at all
  #
  # Both loops used to run one `io.read_byte` per octet. That is correct and it is what keeps
  # the reader from over-reading past the body boundary — but on the DEADLINE path (which is
  # the one every proxied request and response head actually takes, see `ClientConn`) it also
  # re-read the clock once per octet to re-arm the drip-feed bound. At ~17 ns a `Time.instant`
  # that is ~8 µs for a 471-byte request head, i.e. most of the codec's per-request cost, spent
  # asking how long bytes that had ALREADY ARRIVED took to arrive. `IO#peek` hands back what
  # the socket's buffer is already holding, so the clock is read once per FILL instead: the
  # deadline is still checked before every read that can block, which is the only place a
  # drip-feed can hide. `bench/head_read_bench.cr` measures both paths.
  #
  # Consumption stays exact. `io.skip` advances only over the bytes copied here, so a head
  # that ends mid-chunk leaves the body's first octet unread, exactly as the byte-at-a-time
  # loop did. An `IO` with no `peek` (`PrefixIO`, a test double) returns nil and keeps the
  # original loop — so the legs that wrap one, chiefly `ClientConn#read_head_within`'s
  # 100-continue response head, still read a byte at a time. `Bytes.empty` back from `peek`
  # is EOF and nothing else: `IO::Buffered#peek` blocks to fill first (Crystal 1.21).
  #
  # It does so, note, WITHOUT consulting `read_buffering?`, which `#read_byte` honours — so on
  # a socket with read buffering turned off this would fill the user-space buffer where the
  # old loop did not. Nothing in gori turns it off, and leftovers stay readable through the

  #
  # For a bare-LF-TERMINATED response head the "strict" side is `parse_response_head`'s LF
  # reading instead (RFC 9112 §2.2), and the comparison is between two LF-lenient readers:
  # they still split on a lone CR, an obs-fold or `Content-Length : 5`, and any of those on a
  # framing header is refused here exactly as it is in a CRLF head. A CRLF-only reader is a
  # third party, and it is NOT absent: it reads on past that blank line to the next CRLFCRLF.
  # The response reader answers for it when that CRLFCRLF is buffered (`strict_reading_end`
  # hands back the longer head, which this then judges the old way); when it is not, the
  # connection is retired and leftover bytes are flagged on the flow.
  #
  # This is the RESPONSE-side counterpart to obfuscated_header?, and it is deliberately
  # narrower. request_framing rejects on ANY obfuscation because a request's peer is the
  # operator's own browser, which never emits one — so a blunt rule costs nothing. A
  # RESPONSE's peer is the whole internet, and the sloppy-but-harmless origins that emit a
  # bare LF or an obs-fold on some unrelated header (embedded devices, legacy CGI) are
  # exactly the systems a pentester points gori at. Refusing those outright would break the
  # target's pages and read as "gori is broken". So: reject only when the ambiguity actually
  # lands on Content-Length / Transfer-Encoding, and let everything else through byte-exact.
  #
  # obfuscated_header? is the cheap gate — a clean CRLF head can hide nothing, so the common
  # path is one byte scan and no allocation at all; only a head that already looks odd pays
  # for the two views.
  #
  # The views can agree and the message still be read two ways: `Content-Length: 5\n\r\nX: y\r\n
  # \r\nhello` gives both `content-length:5`, but a lenient recipient ENDS THE HEAD at the
  # `\n\r\n` and takes `X: y\r` as the body, where this parse takes `hello`. So a head a lenient
  # recipient ends early (`lenient_head_end`) is ambiguous too once it declares a body — a
  # Content-Length other than 0 or any Transfer-Encoding. Without one, only the head/body split
  # inside this one message differs, never where the next message starts: a close-delimited
