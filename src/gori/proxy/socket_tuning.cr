module Gori::Proxy
  # Centralizes read/write timeouts and TCP keepalive for the proxy's client and upstream
  # legs. A per-read timeout while reading a request head/body or writing a response defeats
  # silent slowloris (a peer that connects then stalls) and RUDY (a client that stops reading
  # the response). Once a connection becomes a long-lived tunnel/relay (WebSocket / SSE /
  # blind CONNECT / h2), the timeout is RELAXED so a legitimately-idle tunnel isn't torn down,
  # and SO_KEEPALIVE takes over reaping a dead (half-open) peer without a wall-clock cutoff on
  # live-but-idle traffic. Resolving the underlying Socket through the TLS/PrefixIO wrappers lets
  # every seam relax by handle (`SocketTuning.relax(@io)`) without threading raw sockets through
  # ClientConn/Tls::Tunnel signatures.

    # Per-read/write timeout while reading a request head/body or writing a response. Matches
    # the upstream leg's existing 30 s (Settings.io_timeout) — a stall THIS long between reads
    # is treated as a dead/hostile peer. It is per-read (per 64 KiB copy iteration), not a
    # whole-body budget, so only a ≥30 s stall trips it, never a genuinely slow-but-progressing
    # transfer.

    # timeout alone can't catch a byte-at-a-time drip that keeps resetting it; this bounds the

    # bounded separately by CLIENT_IO_TIMEOUT.

    # TCP keepalive so a half-open peer on a RELAXED tunnel is still eventually reaped
