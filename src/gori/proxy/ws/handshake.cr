module Gori::Proxy::WS
  # The one header gori removes from a WebSocket handshake it relays (#518).
  #
  # `WS::Relay` stores frame payloads verbatim and never decodes an extension, so a
  # socket that negotiated `permessage-deflate` was captured as a deflate stream
  # presented as the message: History, the detail view, `gori run history show`,
  # MCP `get_flow`, the decoder and export all read those bytes as the payload.
  # Removing the client's OFFER is what stops the negotiation, because extension
  # negotiation is offer-driven (RFC 6455 §9.1): a conformant origin can only accept
  # from what it was offered, so with nothing offered neither peer compresses and the
  # captured frames are the messages.
  #
  # This is gori's first hop-by-hop removal on the WS path and it is DELIBERATE. It
  # cannot be made lazy the way #512's h2 re-encode was: extension negotiation happens
  # once, in the 101 handshake, with no renegotiation, so by the time a capture
  # consumer exists the window has closed. The cost is stated plainly: a
  # deflate-capable app loses compression through gori, and gori changes bytes on the
  # wire while merely observing. The trade is that the status quo was not "byte-exact
  # and correct", it was byte-exact on the wire and WRONG in the store; an operator who
  # needs a compressed socket untouched has TLS passthrough, which leaves the host
  # alone entirely.
  #
  # The WHOLE field goes, not just the `permessage-deflate` parameter. `Relay` is
  # extension-blind by construction (it reads the RFC 6455 frame header and stores the
  # payload), and ANY negotiated extension may transform that payload or give the RSV
  # bits a meaning, so every one of them breaks capture the same way. Removing the field
  # entire is also what `Repeater::WsEngine.build_handshake` already does.
  #
  # BOTH halves of the negotiation go, and they go together. Removing only the client's
  # offer used to be the policy, on the argument that stripping an accept the origin
  # believes in would leave it compressing into a client that saw no acceptance and must
  # then fail the connection on the first RSV1 frame (RFC 6455 §5.2). That argument is
  # sound — for a handshake gori did NOT strip. It is exactly backwards for one gori did:
  # an origin cannot "believe in" an acceptance of something it was never offered, so the
  # accept is answering a header that no longer exists, and relaying it is what manufactures
  # a desync rather than what avoids one. The client took the 101 at its word, turned
  # permessage-deflate on and sent RSV1 frames into an origin that had negotiated nothing —
  # the §5.2 connection failure the old comment was trying to prevent, aimed at the other
  # peer. History read the same way round: an origin sending an unsolicited accept.
  #
  # `carries_extensions?` on the head gori ACTUALLY SENT is the condition that tells the two
  # cases apart, and `ClientConn#settle_ws_extensions` is where it is asked. An acceptance on
  # a handshake gori left alone (an operator who put
  # the offer back with a Match&Replace rule, or an origin violating §4.1) is still relayed
  # untouched: there the two peers do agree, and gori's store is the only thing that suffers.

    # 6455 §11.3.2), so it is left byte-exact (P7) rather than rewritten for nothing.
    #
    # `Upgrade` is a comma-separated protocol list (RFC 7230 §6.7), so match the TOKEN
    # rather than the whole field-value: `Upgrade: websocket, h2c` is still a WebSocket

    # WebSocket branch entirely and was relayed as an opaque byte tunnel — no frames
    # captured, no `part: ws` rule, no `proto:ws` hold — on a socket gori can decode.
    # Two predicates for one field-value is what let that disagreement exist.
    #
    # `HeaderList#lists?` and not a `get?(…).split(',')` of its own, for the half that fix
    # missed: RFC 9110 §5.3 lets a list-valued field arrive as repeated field LINES, and `get?`
    # reads only the last of them — so `Upgrade: h2c` + `Upgrade: websocket` was recognised
