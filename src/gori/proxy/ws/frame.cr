  # (see `MessageGate`'s header), so there the controls go out immediately and the message's
  # own frames follow whenever the operator releases them. With nothing interleaved — every

  #     server that caches on it, or an intermediary that assumes it varies, is testable
  #     only if the operator picks the bytes.
  #   * `mask: false` — a client frame with no mask at all. §5.1 says the server MUST fail
  #     the connection; whether it does is the single most common hardening question, and
  #     the flag existed but nothing above it could reach it.
  #   * `declared_len` — the length HEADER, decoupled from the payload actually written.
  #     A receiver believes the header, so this shape can never be captured off a wire and
  #     can only ever be authored. Under-declaring truncates the frame from the receiver's
  #     point of view and leaves the remainder to be parsed as the next header; over-
  #     declaring makes it wait for bytes that are not coming. Both are framing tests.
  #
  # Nothing here is validated. A control frame over 125 bytes, an RSV bit on a socket with
  # no extension, a length that lies: those are the payloads, and a send path that refuses
  # them is a send path that cannot ask the question (P0/P7).
