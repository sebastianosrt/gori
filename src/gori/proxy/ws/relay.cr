  # Two "no"s — which is every socket for an operator who has configured neither — run `pump`,
  # the pre-existing loop, completely untouched. Either "yes" runs `pump_assembling`, which
  # buffers a message to FIN and then runs it through ONE pipeline: rewrite, then hold. The
  # hold's edit is a STAGE inside that pipeline, not a second one beside it — two pipelines
  # would mean the operator editing bytes the rules had not seen, or rules re-running over an
  # operator's edit. Even on that path, a message neither stage changed goes out as the peer's
  # own frames — every fragment, in order, with its own FIN/RSV bits and mask key, and with
  # any PING/PONG that arrived BETWEEN the fragments still sitting where it arrived (RFC 6455
  # §5.4). That last clause is not decoration: whether a peer tolerates a control frame
  # mid-message is a standard hardening probe, so hoisting one — which is what this pump did
  # to every socket with a rule or a catch armed, matching or not — deletes the test rather
  # than running it. The interleave is given up at exactly one point, and only for the message

    # is not destroyed at the deadline any more. `settle` forwards it unedited while the
    # sockets are still open (the disposition every other involuntary release here takes),

    # `MessageGate`'s header exists to prevent. Past this many, exactness is given up for that

    # bounding the parked bytes for free because of it. It does not: `forward_control`
    # deliberately does NOT enforce that cap (a peer that advertises more gets its frame
    # relayed, not its tunnel killed — P7, and see the comment there), so a peer that opens a
    # message with `TEXT fin=0` and then sends eight 16 MiB PINGs parks a second copy of all
    # of them — ~128 MiB per direction, outside the MAX_MESSAGE budget that bounds `@buffer`
    # and `@raw`. Crossing this takes exactly the same disposition as crossing the count:
    # warn once, write everything parked out ahead of the message, and let this frame and
    # every later one overtake. Which bytes reach the wire is unchanged; only where they sit
    # relative to the message's fragments is.

    # only a record — it is a repeater SEED. `run repeater create --flow`, MCP
    # `create_repeater` and the TUI all take every `direction == "out"` row's opcode and
    # bytes straight across, by design (a binary frame and an invalid-UTF-8 text frame both
    # have to round-trip), so a 242-byte `[gori] …` sentence written on "out" is replayed to
    # the application under test as a masked client→server TEXT frame the client never sent —
    # a fabricated, malformed message injected into the operator's own test case, and a
    # `sent 11 message(s)` for 10 client frames. **A diagnostic is not traffic.**

    # which side it is about, so the SENTENCE has to — see `AssemblingPump#side`. Readers get

      # A control frame (ping/pong/close) never takes part in a rewrite or a hold, and it is
      # forwarded byte-exact. WHEN it is forwarded has two answers, and the difference is the
      # §5.4 interleave.
      #
      # While this pump is withholding a message's fragments and nothing has yet been changed
      # or held, the frame is PARKED at its arrival position (`park_control?`) and rides out
      # inside the message's own wire bytes — so `TEXT fin=0 "AAA"` / `PING` / `CONT fin=1
      # "BBB"` reaches the peer in that order, the order the byte-exact pump has always given
      # it. Writing it immediately instead put the PING first on every socket with a `part:
      # ws` rule or a `proto:ws` catch armed, matching or not, which silently deleted the
      # test an operator arms such a socket to run.
      #
      # Everywhere else it goes out the instant it arrives: between messages, on the
      # passthrough path (whose fragments are already on the wire), past the parking ceiling,
      # and — the one that matters — the moment a hold actually PARKS the message. Holding a
      # PONG behind a human is how a server's 20-30 s ping timer closes the socket out from
      # under the operator, and on that path it is not a refinement, it is the whole reason
      # this pump may not block. See `MessageGate`'s header.
      #
      # A CLOSE is the one control frame that cannot simply overtake: §5.5.1 forbids data
      # frames after it, so anything still queued would never reach the peer. Design D5
      # resolves the queue instead — everything undecided forwards, in order, then the CLOSE.
      # Parking the CLOSE was the alternative and does not work against today's teardown: a
