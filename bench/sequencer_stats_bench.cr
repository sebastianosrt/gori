# Sequencer::Stats.analyze — the full randomness report over a captured token sample.
#
# Worth isolating because analyze is not a one-shot: the TUI re-runs it on a throttle while a
# live capture streams tokens in, and every MCP `sequence_results` poll recomputes it. The
# sample can reach Config::GOAL_CEILING = 50,000 tokens, so several passes over it — and any
# unpresized array sized to total_bytes — are paid repeatedly.
#
# What the timings found, and what the current shape answers:
#
#   1. FOUR of the bit tests each walked the whole symbol bitstream on their own — and
#      Monobit and Runs each called `bits.count(1_u8)` for the SAME count. 6.4M elements
#      traversed four times, 82 ms of a 153 ms report. `Stats::BitScan` is that walk, once.
#   2. The per-symbol-bit bias scan asked `min_len × bps` questions per token where only the
#      SYMBOL in each column matters; a `min_len × (charset + 1)` tally answers all of them
#      with one increment per column per token (23 ms → 0.5 ms at bps 4). Bounded on both
#      sides — see `symbol_bit_ones` — so a corpus of few but very long tokens, where the
#      table would be the report's largest allocation, keeps the direct walk.
#   3. `block_phi` (Approx entropy) indexed its circular window as `(i + m - 1) % n` — an
#      integer division per bit, twice per report — where only the last m-1 windows wrap.
#   4. The hex branch of `detect_sequential` called `t.chars` (and then sliced it) per token
#      to read 16 bytes, and both of its shape guards built a char iterator per token.
