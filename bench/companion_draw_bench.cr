# Companion.draw micro-benchmark. She is drawn on EVERY frame the Runner paints — not just on
# the ~1/second where her sprite actually changes — so anything expensive in the draw path
# is paid per keystroke, per scroll step, per job-spinner tick. This measures the cost that
# is recomputed from scratch each call — resolving the mood palette (Theme.paper/soot plus ~7
# blends, each converting colours to RGB components) — and the draw itself.
