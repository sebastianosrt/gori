# `Codec::Http1.read_head` — the proxy's one IO boundary, measured on BOTH of its paths.
#
# codec_bench covers the plain path only, and the plain path is not the one real traffic
# takes: `ClientConn#read_client_head` and `#safe_read_head` both pass a `deadline` and a
# `timeout_sock`, so every proxied request head and every response head goes through the
# armed-deadline branch of `read_head_result`. Its extra per-iteration work (re-arming the
# drip-feed deadline) is invisible from codec_bench, which is why this harness exists.
#
# `timeout_sock` only ever has `read_timeout=` called on it, so it does NOT have to be the
# socket `io` reads from: feeding the loop an `IO::Memory` while handing it a real (idle)
# socket to arm isolates the codec's own per-head cost from kernel and scheduler noise,
# the same trick capture_bench uses to get stable bytes/op out of the body path.
