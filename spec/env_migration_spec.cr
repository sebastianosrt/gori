# Two halves. The PURE one asserts WIRE EQUIVALENCE, not "the tokens look right": every REQUEST case
# is checked with `safe?`, which runs both texts through the two passes a real send takes (env vars

# beautifully and ships different bytes is the failure this file exists to catch.

# the columns it claims, the ones it must not touch — and that a second opener finds the work done
# rather than doing it again.
