# The RESPONSE head is a slowloris surface too.
#
# `handle_request` has always bounded the CLIENT head with `deadline:`/`timeout_sock:` (the
# drip-feed a per-read timeout can't catch), and `Repeater::Engine#read_response_head` carries
# the same bound on the origin side citing this file. `ClientConn#safe_read_head` — the ONLY way
# a response head is read, on all three of its call sites — passed neither, so an origin emitting
# one header byte per <io_timeout never tripped a timer: the fiber, the client fd, the upstream fd
# and one of `Server`'s connection permits were pinned for as long as it cared to trickle (P6).
#
# The bound itself (raise after the deadline, restore the caller's baseline timeout) is proven in
# spec/proxy/socket_tuning_spec.cr against the same call shape; what these pin is that the proxy
# ASKS for it everywhere, and that asking for it does not cut a slow-but-progressing origin short.
