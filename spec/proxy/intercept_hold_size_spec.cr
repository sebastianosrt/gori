# An intercept HOLD buffers the whole entity so the human can see and edit it
# (`Codec::Body.read_complete`, no `max_bytes`). With intercept on, a page POSTing a multi-GB
# body — or a multi-GB download with the response direction held — grew the proxy heap by the
# whole declared length before anyone was shown anything, and did it BEFORE `@sink.on_request`,
# so the eventual raise lost the flow from History as well.
#
# Every sibling buffering path in `client_conn.cr` already has the ceiling (`MAX_REWRITE_BODY`
# via `rewritable_body_size?`), and the h2 half of this very feature fails a hold open past
# `MAX_DEFERRED_BYTES` (`H2::StreamGate#fail_open`). The h1 hold now does the same: over the
# ceiling the message is NOT held and takes the byte-exact streaming path, with one warning so
# the operator learns why nothing appeared in the queue.
#
# h2 gained its own, LOWER ceiling on the same question in PR #6 (`H2::StreamGate::MAX_HOLD_BODY`,
# 1 MiB): under it a held stream's body is buffered and editable, over it the hold covers the
# head only and DATA streams past. The two numbers differ because an h1 connection carries one
# request and an h2 connection multiplexes ~100 streams — see that constant's comment.
# `spec/proxy/h2/stream_gate_spec.cr` covers the h2 side; this file is the h1 hold's ceiling.
#
# The tests key on "did the head reach the other side promptly?" rather than on shipping 16 MiB:
# a hold reads the body BEFORE writing anything onward, so a held message shows the peer nothing.
