# RFC 8441 extended CONNECT — a WebSocket opened over HTTP/2 (#733).
#
# The relay always worked: the CONNECT stream's DATA frames go out byte-for-byte, and gori
# relays the origin's SETTINGS (SETTINGS_ENABLE_CONNECT_PROTOCOL included) verbatim, so a
# browser facing an 8441 origin is entitled to take this path. What did not work is everything
# above the wire — the socket landed as one opaque DATA blob capped at `Settings.capture_max`,
# so there were no `ws_messages` rows at all. These cover the transcript that replaces it.
#
# The axis every one of them turns on: **a DATA frame boundary and a WebSocket frame boundary
# are unrelated.** A frame straddles two DATA frames as readily as ten frames share one, so the
# reader has to be a stream reassembler and the specs feed it accordingly.
