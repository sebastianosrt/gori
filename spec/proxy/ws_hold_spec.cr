# WebSocket message HOLD (#500 step 2): `WS::MessageGate` in front of the assembling pump.
#
# The headline proof is the first example: a message can sit in the queue for as long as a
# human needs while PING/PONG keeps flowing past it and the opposite direction keeps running.
# That is what makes a WS hold survivable at all — a blocked pump would stop relaying the
# client's PONG, and a server pinging on the usual 20-30 s timer closes the socket well inside
# a minute, so a two-minute edit would reliably kill the connection being inspected.
