# The layering contract, executable. Core subsystems must not know that a surface exists:
# `store/`, `proxy/`, `probe/`, `fuzz/`, `miner/`, `discover/`, `sequencer/` and `oast/` may
# not reference `Tui::`, `CLI::` or `MCP::` in code. Dependencies run one way — surfaces
# depend on engines, engines depend on Store and the codecs, and nothing depends on a
# surface (AGENTS.md "Three surfaces, one engine layer"; DESIGN.md §2.1).
#
# This is the runnable form of the `grep -rnE '\b(Tui|CLI|MCP)::' …` self-check documented
# in AGENTS.md and DESIGN.md §2.1, over exactly the same file set.
#
# The assertion is "every hit is on a COMMENT line", NOT a hit count. A comment may point at
# a caller — naming the CLI formatter that delegates to an engine is useful, and several such
# comments exist today — while code may not. The number of those comments drifts as they are
# edited, which is precisely why counting them would be a spec that fails on prose changes
# while catching no layering violation.
#
# Crystal has no block comments, so a comment line is simply one whose `lstrip` starts with
# `#`. That is the whole definition, on purpose: a smarter tokenizer (tracking string
# literals, heredocs, trailing comments) would be more code than the rule it guards, and the
# rule only needs to separate "a sentence about a caller" from "a call into a surface".
