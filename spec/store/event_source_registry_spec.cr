# `events.source` is a FREE STRING — `insert_event` writes whatever it is handed — and three
# surfaces narrow on it: the Activity pane's `s` chip (`ProjectView::ACT_SOURCES`), that chip's
# keybinding help, and MCP `list_events{source}`. All three read `Store::EVENT_SOURCES`, which is
# what keeps them from drifting apart.
#
# What nothing kept in step was the list against the WRITERS. `runner/evidence.cr` started
# writing `issues` (an operator froze a copy of a flow onto an issue) without registering it, and
# nothing complained: the rows landed in the feed, the `s` chip could never narrow to them, and
# `list_events{source:"issues"}` came back INVALID_ARGUMENT naming a set that omitted a source the
# project writes. So the registry is checked against the tree, the way `peer_notices_spec` pins
# its two wirings.

# statement is invisible to the grep above, so a future one coining its own source word would
