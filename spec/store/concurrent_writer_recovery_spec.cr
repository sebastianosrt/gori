# #752: a TUI and a `gori mcp` on one project are two SQLite writers, and a collision between
# them used to be TERMINAL rather than momentary. The losing write left its statement un-reset,
# SQLite then refused the ROLLBACK, and the writer's connection — pinned for the life of the
# store — stayed in a transaction it could never close. Every later write failed the same way,
# the open transaction kept the WAL write lock away from the peer, and the TUI went on running
# while nothing it captured was saved. Only restarting the process cleared it.
#
# These examples stand in for the peer process with a second connection to the same file: SQLite
# locks per CONNECTION, so one pool holding a write transaction is the same contention a second
# gori would produce. `busy_timeout=1` is what makes them fast — the real 5 s is exactly the wait
# these examples want to skip, not something they are testing.
