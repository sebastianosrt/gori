# Drives ONE `Gori::Tui::Overlay` through the exact lifecycle the shell gives it —
# open → keys / clicks / wheel / IME preedit → commit or cancel — with no terminal and
# no Runner.
#
# The Runner needs a live tty, so it cannot be unit-tested; every migrated modal's spec
# would otherwise re-derive the shell's generic dispatch by hand (and each slightly
# differently). This is that dispatch, written once:
#
#   * `press` / `click` mirror `Runner#dispatch_overlay_key` / `#dispatch_overlay_click`
#     LINE FOR LINE — :cancel closes, :commit runs `commit` and closes iff it returns
#     true, anything else stays open.
#   * `drag` mirrors `Runner#dispatch_drag`'s OVERLAY tier, including its `supports_drag?`
#     gate: a modal that never opted in must see the gesture do nothing, which is what the
#     shell does. `double_click` mirrors `#dispatch_double_click`'s, which has NO such gate
#     (`double_click_target?` asks an overlay nothing — a list card with no text to drag over
#     still answers a pair on a row): the outcome is applied like a click's, `:pass` falls
#     back to the ordinary click.
#   * `open?` mirrors whether the shell still holds the modal in `@active_overlay`.
#   * `commits` counts runs of the injected `on_commit` closure — the open-site behaviour
#     a migrated modal no longer carries itself.
#   * `closes` counts runs of `on_close`, the nested-modal pop-back the shell performs
#     AFTER dropping the modal (see the ordering note on `close!`).
#
# If those Runner methods ever change, change them HERE too: this harness is the
# spec-side statement of that contract, and a modal spec that passes against a stale
# harness proves nothing about the real shell.
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT MODEL: the shell's pre-filter. `^C`/`^D` (quit-arm), `^B` (reveal) and
# the space-menu / copy-as / send-to / `^F` prompts are all claimed in `Runner#handle_key`
# BEFORE a migrated modal is dispatched to, so those keys never reach an overlay in the
# real app. Driving them through this harness will "work" here and be dead in the TUI —
# assert them against the Runner ladder instead.
#
# Note that `press`/`click` collapse `:cancel` and a truthy `:commit` to the same
# `:closed`, because that is what the shell does. An example that cares WHICH one it was
# must also assert `commits`, or call `overlay.handle_key` directly for the raw vocabulary.

  # The body rect the shell hands an overlay. 80x24 is the size every existing overlay
  # spec centres its card in, so box geometry matches what those specs already assert.
  #
  # CAVEAT: this is the whole SCREEN, not `layout.body`. On a real 80x24 terminal the shell
  # passes Rect(2, 4, 76, 18) — 6 rows shorter and offset — so a card gets 22 usable rows
  # here where production gives 16. Every migrated overlay's `overlay_box` bails out with
  # `nil` below a floor (`w < 28 || h < 8`), and that nil path — where the base
  # `handle_click` turns EVERY click into a dismiss — is therefore unreachable through this
  # default. If your modal is tall, or you care about the small-terminal path, pass an
  # explicit `area:` rather than trusting this.
