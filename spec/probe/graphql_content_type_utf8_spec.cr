# A `Content-Type` is read straight off the wire (`Http1.parse_headers` builds header values
# with a bare `String.new`, and obs-text 0x80-0xFF is legal there), so a multipart boundary can
# carry a byte that is not valid UTF-8 — a Content-Type parser-differential payload, or just a
# client that picked its boundary out of a non-UTF-8 charset. PCRE RAISES on the first illegal
# byte instead of not matching, and the two probe call sites that reach `Graphql.from_body` are
# the only ones that hand it an unscrubbed value. The raise landed in `MediaType.boundary` and
# took out the whole flow's passive pass (Tech is RULES[0], and `scan_detail` swallows it), then
# the same shape came back through the TUI's "Run active scan" estimate, which had no rescue at
# all. Both are pinned here.

# `graphql` substring the Tech / GraphqlIntrospection byte gates open on.
