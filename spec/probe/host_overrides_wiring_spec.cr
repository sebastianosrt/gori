# #367 was "every TUI workbench tool forgot `overrides:`". This is its sequel, and the
# interesting part is that #367's fix did not prevent it: THREE more callers of the same
# dialer were written afterwards and each one forgot the same argument again —
#
#   src/gori/authorize/engine.cr    the Authorize tab / CLI / MCP (the operator's report)
#   src/gori/probe/active.cr        every active probe a headless scan sends
#   src/gori/probe/analyzer.cr      every active probe the live TUI sends
#
# — because `Fuzz::Sender#overrides` is a trailing optional argument, so forgetting it
# compiles, sends, and reports findings. Nothing is refused and nothing is logged; the probes
# simply go to whatever DNS resolves while the operator's HOST OVERRIDES pane sits there being
# ignored, and the findings are real findings about the wrong host.
#
# So this file pins the fix at two levels. The `describe` blocks below are BEHAVIOURAL — each
# one dials a real loopback responder through a host that cannot resolve, so the assertion can
# only pass if the override reached the socket, and each is paired with the control run that
# proves it (drop the argument and the send fails). The source-grep guard at the bottom is the
# part that catches the NEXT caller, which is the failure mode all three of these were.

# `execute_active` is the live analyzer's send seam (the twin of the loop in `Active.analyze`).
# Reached in production from a spawned fiber, so a spec drives it directly rather than racing
# `run_active_now` — the same reopen-the-class idiom `passive_feed_source_spec.cr` uses.
