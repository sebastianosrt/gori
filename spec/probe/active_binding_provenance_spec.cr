# The PROVENANCE axis at the PROBE ACTIVE send seam (round 7, hunter finding 1a).
#
# Probe active builds every probe from a CAPTURED request. Real captured traffic is full of
# `$NAME`-shaped bytes the operator never typed — Mongo `$ne`/`$where`, JSON Schema
# `$ref`/`$schema`, and a GraphQL operation, which is MADE of `$variable` references. The
# `$`+`[A-Za-z_]`+`[A-Za-z0-9_]*` grammar has no delimiter requirement, so with an extract
# rule named `id` bound, `Active.analyze`'s one-arg `sender.send(plan.request)` ran
# `Env.expand_bindings` over the whole captured body and shipped
# `query GetUser(<live session token>: ID!)` to the target — a real credential in its access
# log, inside a request nobody authored, with the scan reporting itself clean.
#
# Round 6 fixed the identical class in the param-miner (see miner/binding_provenance_spec.cr)
# with the polarity INVERTED: there the INJECTED candidate is verbatim and the captured seed
# expands. Here the captured request IS the test case and nothing in the buffer is
# operator-authored, so the whole request is verbatim.
#
# The backend below mimics `Fuzz::Sender` exactly (the same
# `Env.expand_bindings` pass), so every assertion is on the bytes that would hit the socket.

# A layer with the name DECLARED and BOUND — the send-time binding half.
