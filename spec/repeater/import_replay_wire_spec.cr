# Issue #400 — an imported CRLF-bearing request target must replay onto the wire BYTE-EXACT.
#
# The import path (src/gori/import/builder.cr) deliberately stops rejecting a control byte in a
# URL's PATH/QUERY: that byte is the operator's own smuggling payload, and reproducing a broken
# request is the point of a security-testing proxy (P7; DESIGN.md §7). This file proves it end
# to end, on the SOCKET rather than in a string — #390/#397/#401 established that for this class
# a string-level assertion proves nothing, because something downstream (a codec guard, an
# origin re-parse, an Env pass) could re-validate or mangle the bytes between store and wire.
#
# The chain under test is the exact one every headless replay takes:
#   Import::Builder.request_head  (the serializer HAR/OAS/--urls all call)
#     → Store::FlowDetail          (the captured flow, reconstructed DB-free like replay_reconstruct_spec)
#       → Repeater::FlowRequest.build → Repeater::Plan → Repeater::Sender → upstream.write
# Reconstruct a captured flow exactly as `gori run repeater send --flow` does, from a head the
# IMPORT serializer produced, then read what actually reaches the origin socket.
