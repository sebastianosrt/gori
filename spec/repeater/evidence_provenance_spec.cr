# is AUTHORING in a line-buffer editor, and running them on stored evidence changes bytes
# nobody typed. One signal rather than several, because both were off for the same reason and
# the surfaces had already drifted on which of them they remembered to turn off.

  # The third draft-time policy, and the one round 2 left running: `$KEY` SUBSTITUTION.
  #
  # This block used to assert the opposite ("still expands a resolvable $KEY in evidence
  # bytes"), on the theory that a surface might have merged operator-typed overrides into
  # these bytes and those still had to expand. The theory was right and the seam was wrong:
  # by the time the builder sees one merged wire, nothing can tell the operator's bytes from
  # the capture's — so the expansion also ran over the CAPTURE, and a project that happened
  # to define an ordinary name (`filter`, `top`, `where`, `token`, `user`) rewrote the stored
  # request and re-framed its Content-Length to match, silently. Meanwhile MCP's flow path
  # reached the intended end state by a DIFFERENT mechanism (`expand_request: false`) and did
  # not, so the two headless surfaces sent different requests from the same flow id.
  #
  # A surface that merges overrides now expands them at ITS OWN merge seam, where it still
  # knows whose bytes are whose — see `spec/cli/run/repeater_headers_spec.cr`.
