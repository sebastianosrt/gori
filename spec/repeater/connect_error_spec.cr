# Round 4 / F1. `dial_tls_result` has always returned a `DialError` whose `kind` says WHICH
# layer broke — that is the documented reason `DialErrorKind` exists — and the proxy path has
# consumed it since #323. Every DIRECT sender (repeater, fuzz, mine, sequence, discover, probe
# active, and `ConnPool`, all of which reach the network through `Repeater::Engine`) read only
# `detail` and fell through to one sentence:
#
#   connect failed: host:port — host unreachable (DNS/refused/timeout) or the origin's TLS
#   certificate failed verification (e.g. self-signed/expired)
#
# A cert rejection, a handshake failure and a plain TCP refusal have three different fixes
# (add their private CA / "this port is not TLS" / a firewall-DNS problem) and that sentence
# named the third for all three.
