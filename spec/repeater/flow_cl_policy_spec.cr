# The CAPTURED-FLOW Content-Length policy.
#
# `send_request{flow_id}` documents a flow replay as byte-exact and was not: it inherited
# `auto_content_length: true` and rewrote the stored CL line on every send. So a captured
# `Content-Length: 99` over a 2-byte body — a CL-desync probe someone captured *because* it
# is wrong — went out as `Content-Length: 2`, with `isError:false` and no notice. The
# operator read a verdict about a request gori never sent. `gori run repeater <flow-id>`
# had the same behaviour.
#
# The one case that must still recompute is why the resync exists on this path at all: a
# `$KEY` in the body, whose expansion changes the body length AFTER the CL was framed over
# the pre-expansion bytes. Distinguishing the two is what these examples pin.
