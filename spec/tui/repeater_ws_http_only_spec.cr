# `^V` on a Repeater tab holding a WebSocket handshake: WS → HTTP/1.1 → HTTP/2 → WS.
#
# The axis these specs guard is that gori has TWO WebSocket questions, not one — what the tab
# HOLDS (`ws_content?`, which decides what gets persisted) and what `^R` DOES with it
# (`ws_mode?`, which decides the engine, the panes and the feature gates). Collapsing them
# back into one flag is how a tab sent as plain HTTP loses the frames it is still holding.
