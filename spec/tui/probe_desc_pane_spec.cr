# The Probe detail's DESCRIPTION pane.
#
# `Probe.remediation` writes a sentence per rule, and the detail gave it ONE `width:`-capped
# row of the meta block. On a normal-width pane every rule but the tersest ended in `…`, so
# text that was in the binary and on the screen could not be read — and, being a `screen.text`
# call rather than a pane, could not be scrolled to, selected, or copied either.
#
# It is now a `ReadPane` in a card of its own: it takes focus (`⇥`, or `↓` off the last
# affected URL), takes a caret and a selection, and answers the detail's read verbs — which is
# what puts the remediation text on the clipboard through `y` and the space menu's Copy. It
# takes no edit at all; `ReadPane` has no edit path, which is the point rather than a limit.
