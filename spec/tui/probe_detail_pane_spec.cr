# The Probe detail's AFFECTED URLS region, brought onto the shape `IssuesView`'s RELATED card
# was given in dae5cf21.
#
# It was an OPEN region — an `inner_divider`, a text heading, then the URL rows running to the
# bottom of the pane. Open-ended blocks read as "the rest of this pane" rather than as a thing
# with its own edges, which is the wrong reading for the one region of a drill-in an operator
# actually navigates; and it was the last detail pane in the tree still drawn that way.
#
# The defect underneath the cosmetics is the one this file's `agrees with the draw` example
# guards: the renderer walked `rect.y + 5` → divider → heading → list while `affected_rect`
# wrote out the `rect.y + 7` that lands on, under a comment claiming it was "the derivation
# `render_detail` walks". Two derivations agreeing by arithmetic, not by construction — move a
# row in the renderer and every click in the URL list addresses the wrong row, with nothing
# raising and no test failing.
