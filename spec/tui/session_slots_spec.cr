# The TUI half of the session-slot surfaces (PR #10): the `session:NAME` top-bar chip, the
# picker behind it, and the identities card's write path.
#
# There is no Runner in any spec in this repo (`Runner.new` appears nowhere under spec/) — it
# owns a terminal — so the picker's open-site and the controller's write are pinned by reading
# the source, the way spec/tui/subtab_find_key_spec.cr does. Comments are stripped first: a
# comment explaining a rule contains the tokens the rule looks for, and a whole-file
# `includes?` would pass on the strength of its own prose.
