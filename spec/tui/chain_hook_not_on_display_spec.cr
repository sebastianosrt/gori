# A `§value¦chain§` step can be an `exec:` since #818 — the operator's own command, run with
# their privileges and allowed, by definition, to have side effects. A surface that REPLAYS such
# a chain to DRAW something therefore withholds it: drawing is not a send, and neither is
# restoring a tab that was saved with one in it.
#
# The counts are the assertion, and each example pins its own number rather than "few" — the
# defects these cover were 1-per-frame, 1-per-keystroke, 2-per-send and 1-per-row-selection, and
# only a count tells those apart from correct behaviour. `Rules#transform_message` makes the same
# argument for the Rewriter's OUTPUT pane (`run_hooks: false`, and the pane says so); these are
# the Decoder-chain half of it, which that seam left open.
#
# NOT covered here, deliberately: the Decoder tab's own chain field, which is live by design —
# it is the workbench `exec:` was built for. See `docs/content/guide/scripting.md`.
