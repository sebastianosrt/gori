# How a confirm dialog is DRESSED, which had split into two conventions.
#
# `ConfirmDialog` renders both strings verbatim — the heading through `Frame.card`, the
# button through `render_button` — so the two spellings really did reach the screen. Eleven
# dialogs shouted an uppercase noun over a lowercase button (`DELETE ISSUE` / `delete`),
# matching every card title in gori; six newer ones used sentence case with a capitalised
# button (`Delete rule` / `Delete`), which also put a `Delete` next to the `cancel` that
# `ConfirmDialog` supplies by default — mixed case inside one dialog.
#
# The rule: the heading names the subject in caps, the buttons are lowercase verbs.
