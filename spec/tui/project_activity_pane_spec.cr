# The Project tab's ACTIVITY pane (#864) — the human window over the #124 event feed.
#
# Four of the expectations below exist because the obvious implementation is wrong in a way
# that reads as working:
#
#   * the cursor is anchored to an EVENT ID, not a row index. The list is newest-first and
#     prepends, so an index cursor slides onto a neighbour the moment an agent writes and `↵`
#     then acts on a row nobody selected;
#   * "no activity recorded yet" and "no events match …" are DIFFERENT sentences. Once a chip
#     is on, `rows.empty?` stops meaning the feed is quiet, and the two readings send the
#     operator opposite ways;
#   * the `warn` chip has to match the Sequencer's "warning" spelling too, or half the feed's
#     warnings become invisible;
#   * `act_list_inner` is the single offset source — the filter bar and the detail band both
#     eat interior rows, and a hit-test that knows about only one lands on the wrong event.
