# disposition — no stack unwind, so `run_tui`'s `ensure term.close` never ran and the
# operator's pane was handed back with ECHO/ICANON/ISIG/OPOST off, the alternate screen up
# and SGR-1006 mouse reporting still on (only `reset` recovered it).
#
# The one thing that cannot be exercised in-process is the `run_tui` call site itself, which
# needs a live /dev/tty.
