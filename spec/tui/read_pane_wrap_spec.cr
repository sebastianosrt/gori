# hand-rolled copy per pane. Its five consumers (Decoder OUTPUT, Intercept preview, Probe
# AFFECTED, the OAST callback detail, the Rewriter PREVIEW OUTPUT) all take it; the four that
# self-draw through `viewport_top` deliberately do not.

# One column wider than the rect: `Frame.scroll_gauge` rides the border column immediately right
# of the content, so a rect flush to the backend's edge silently drops it (see read_pane_spec).
