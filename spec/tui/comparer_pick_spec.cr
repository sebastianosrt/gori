# `a` / `b` on the Comparer tab draw their rows THROUGH the active Scope lens, the way History
# and the Sitemap already do. Runner owns a live terminal and is constructed nowhere under spec/,
# so this open-site is pinned in source like `spec/tui/subtab_find_key_spec.cr`. The two halves a
# source scan cannot reach are covered where they live: the lens SQL in `spec/scope_spec.cr`, the
# "no flows in scope" card in `spec/tui/flow_picker_spec.cr`.
#
# Comments are stripped first. The comment above the fetch NAMES `recent_flows` to explain why
# the call moved, so a whole-body `includes?` would pass on the strength of that prose.
