# The `0` card is the one place an operator meets the whole tab catalog, so what it says about
# a tab that is off the bar is the whole of what "off the bar" means to them. It used to say
# `·`, a muted label and the literal word "hidden" — the vocabulary of the tab-HIDING feature
# the nine slots replaced, about a tab that opens on the very next keypress.
#
# These are rendering assertions on purpose: the defect was never in what the card DID (↵
# always worked on every row) but in how it read. MemoryBackend records chars + fg, which is
# exactly the pair that was lying.
