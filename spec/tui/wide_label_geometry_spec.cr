# Label geometry measured in CELLS, not characters.
#
# Every one of these helpers used `String#size` to place the thing drawn after a label, size
# the card around it, or hit-test it. That is exact for ASCII and half the truth for Hangul
# (two cells per syllable), so a Korean label overlapped its value, a Korean button was
# clickable across half its band, and a centred footer sat a quarter-width to the right.
# `Screen#text` already advanced by display width — these are the arithmetic sites that had
# to agree with it before any label can be drawn in Korean.
