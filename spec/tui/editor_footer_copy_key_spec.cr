# `^Y` is Copy in every text box (see `spec/verbs/core_spec.cr` for the keymap half). The
# footers were the half that never got told: five INS strips named it, five did not, and the
# operator's only route to the key was reading the commit that added it.
#
# Both rules here are about a footer that describes a mode it is not in.
#
#   A. A strip that says "⇧arrows select" and names no copy key. The Fuzzer template editor
#      was the pure case: it told you a band could be built and then named nothing that
#      copies one, while the bare `y` the READ strip advertises is — in that mode — a literal
#      character that REPLACES the band you just built. One keystroke, no toast, selection
#      gone. That is the bug report `^Y` exists to answer, and the footer is where it lands.
#
#   B. A strip that starts with `type ` and still offers `space cmds`. JWT's HEADER, PAYLOAD
#      and SECRET are always-typing panes (`JwtController#edit_json` / `#edit_secret` insert
#      the character; `#handle_body_key` only defers ctrl/alt chords), so that space typed a
#      space. It cost the one token with room to say which key copies — on the three panes
#      where `^Y` is not the convenient copy but the ONLY one.
#
# Checkable in source and cheap to check, which is the reason to: these are hand-written
# prose strings with no compiler behind them, and the pair of them drifted for ten strips.

  # Every double-quoted literal on `line`, with `#{…}` chord interpolations blanked (a hint

  # for its whole life. Anchored to the KEYMAP rather than to a hand-kept list: a verb only
