# `^V` picks the transport `^R` dials — h1 ⇄ h2 on an ordinary tab, and (since the WebSocket
# override landed) WS → h1 → h2 → WS on a tab holding a handshake. Nothing on screen said so:
# the key was discoverable only from the footer of one pane in one mode, so a tab that could be
# asked three different questions looked like a tab that could be asked one.
#
# The ` ^V:… ` chip fixes that, and it rides the TARGET band rather than the REQUEST border on
# purpose: the request border is a HALF-width column that already carries ^R:SEND, ^L:CL,
# ^U:PRETTY and the READ/INS chip, and a fifth badge there pushes the mode chip past `min_x` on a
# 100-column terminal — the badge chain drops its leftmost first. The TARGET band is full width
# and already holds the other "how do we connect" facts (the URL, the SNI override).
