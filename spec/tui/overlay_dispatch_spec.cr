# The polymorphic Overlay seam (src/gori/tui/overlay.cr) is what let the Runner collapse
# a modal's ~13 scattered `case @overlay` ladder entries into one @active_overlay dispatch.
# The Runner itself can't be unit-tested without a terminal, so these specs lock the
# CONTRACT the Runner's generic dispatch relies on:
#   - handle_key / handle_click return the :stay | :commit | :cancel vocabulary
#   - commit runs the injected on_commit closure and honours its Bool (false keeps it open)
#   - title / hint / key supply the chrome the collapsed ladders used to hard-code
# If this contract holds, migrating the next overlay onto the seam is a local change.
#
# Everything below drives the modal through OverlayHarness (spec/support/overlay_harness.cr),
# which replays Runner#dispatch_overlay_key / #dispatch_overlay_click exactly. A migration
# batch should reach for the harness rather than re-deriving that dispatch by hand.
