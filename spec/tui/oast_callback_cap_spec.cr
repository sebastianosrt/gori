# The OAST callbacks buffer is the ONE result list in the TUI whose growth is paced by a
# NETWORK PEER rather than by the operator.
#
# `OastController#apply_callback` appended one `CbRow` per interaction — each holding the full
# `raw_request` AND `raw_response` strings — with no cap and no eviction anywhere in the file,
# and `@seen` interned one uid per row in lockstep. Nothing trimmed either; the only thing that
# ever cleared them was a full `reload`, which then re-materialised the WHOLE table
# (`oast_callbacks_since(0)` has no LIMIT) and handed it straight back.
#
# The operator does not fill this one. interact.sh-class domains attract unsolicited
# third-party scanner traffic, and the poller ingests at `POLL_INTERVAL = 5.seconds` for as
# long as the listener lives — so retained bytes were a function of how long the listener was
# left up and how popular the provider's domain is, neither of which the operator controls.
# Notifications and Jobs are bounded; unlike Fuzzer results, this buffer is paced by a remote
# party rather than by an operator-triggered run, so it requires its own hard window.
#
# The fix is a WINDOW, not a destructive trim: the newest `CALLBACK_CAP` rows are held in
# memory, every evicted row is still in `oast_callbacks`, and the pane SAYS SO — a silent cap
# in the one tab whose whole job is evidence is its own defect. These examples pin all three
# halves: the buffer stops growing, `@seen` stops growing with it, and the operator can see it.

# The narrow shell facade a controller is given. Everything here is inert except `session`,
# `jobs` and `notifications` — the only members the callback drain touches — because a
# controller reaches the shell ONLY through this module, so stubbing it is stubbing the shell.
# File-local rather than shared with repeater_refusal_inline_spec's identical double: `Host` is
# ~30 abstract methods and a shared support double would be a fourth file to keep in sync with
# the module every time it grows.
