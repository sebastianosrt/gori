# Repeater "send group" (space → g, the `%%%` pipeline) versus §…§ markers.
#
# `RepeaterView#request_bytes` routes a marked request through `marked_request_bytes` →
# `render_marked(refuse: true)`, which applies each marker's inline Decoder chain and
# REFUSES a chain that cannot run. `pipeline_requests` never reaches either: it goes
# straight to `finalize_wire(expanded_text_to_bytes(…))`. So the group send put the marker
# syntax itself on the wire — reproduced against a recording origin at base:
#
#     POST /one HTTP/1.1
#     Content-Length: 28
#
#     §PAYLOAD-A¦base64-encode§        (c2 a7 … c2 a6 … c2 a7)
#
# while the editor showed `Content-Length: 12` for the rendered `UEFZTE9BRC1B`, under a
# status line reading "send group: 2/2 ok on one connection". The same divergence took the
# `¦chain` refusal off this path: `^R` refuses `§PAYLOAD-A¦no-such-conv§` by name, and
# space→g sent it.
#
# The refusal lives in `RepeaterController.group_marker_refusal` (pure + `self.`, so it is
# testable without a Host double — the reason `.literal_bindings` is), keyed on
# `RepeaterView#markers_active?` so a capture's own inert `§` is not refused. Its natural
# home is `RepeaterView#group_sendable?`, whose comment already names MARK alongside hex /
# gRPC / WS / decode; that file is owned elsewhere this round.

# `space ▸ M` is the third whole-buffer reader, and the one the `^R` refusal did not reach:

#
# `Minimize.run` reads its base text STRUCTURALLY as ONE request — head/body split, then
# header / cookie / param candidates — so on a group buffer it strips lines out of the
# operator's SECOND request and reports them as removals from the first. Measured against a
# recording backend on a two-request buffer, and it is worse than "reads several as one":
#
#   auto-CL OFF  removed ["Cookie:sess", "Cookie:tracker", "Query:keep", "Query:junkA"]
#                → request 2 left dangling inside the "minimized request", 7 probe sends
#   auto-CL ON   removed [… , "Param:%%%\nGET /g2?other"]
#                → the operator's ENTIRE second request deleted and reported as a removed
#                  body PARAMETER; the result is request 1 alone
#
# The second is what `--apply` (and the TUI's write-back) would store over the session. So
# the refusal is STRUCTURAL and must not be scoped to auto-CL — the peer's `group_document?`
# — which is where minimize legitimately parts company with `^R`: with `^L` off a
# whole-buffer `^R` is a byte-exact send and stays allowed, while minimize is meaningless
# either way. The controller now reads the view's own `minimize_refusal`, which owns both
# the predicate and the sentence, so what stops the run and what the operator is told cannot
