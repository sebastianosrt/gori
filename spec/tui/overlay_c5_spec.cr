# Batch C5 of the Overlay migration (#355): the Preferences family — the unified modal and
# the theme / tab-bar / hostnames / env / hotkeys editors it opens.
#
# Everything here rides OverlayHarness, which replays Runner#dispatch_overlay_key /
# #dispatch_overlay_click, so these lock the routing runner.cr no longer spells out:
# a handle_*_key method and six `case @overlay` arms per modal were deleted, and the
# behaviour they encoded now has to live in the overlay or in an injected closure.
#
# The three things worth being careful about, and why each gets examples below:
#   * the ADD/PREFIX sub-modes of the hostnames + env editors folded into their parent
#     overlay, so esc there must cancel the SUB-MODE and leave the modal up;
#   * the hotkey rebinder's capture mode, which the shell routes to ahead of its own
#     ^C/^D quit-arm — the overlay answers for that by BEING a modal, not through
#     `raw_key_capture?`: `Runner.quit_chord_claimed?` yields both chords whenever an
#     Overlay is up (that is what stopped ^D in the Fuzzer payload-set editor from
#     quitting gori), so `raw_key_capture?` now only governs the raw-dispatch branch;
#   * the nested lifecycle, which was a shell-wide `@prefs_return` flag and is now
#     `Overlay#on_close`, running on a cancel AND on a commit that closed.
#
# CAVEAT on driving keys: these overlays branch on `ev.key` for navigation (`key.lower_k?`)
# and on `ev.char` for mnemonics, exactly as the deleted Runner handlers did. So a mnemonic
# is pressed as `press(Key::LowerA, 'a')` and vim-nav as `press(Key::LowerK)` — `type` would
# send every char on Key::LowerA and silently miss the nav branch.
