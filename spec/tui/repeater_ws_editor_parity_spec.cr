# The Repeater's REQUEST column is one pane for plain HTTP and TWO for a WebSocket flow
# (HANDSHAKE REQUEST over MESSAGES) or a decode tab (ENVELOPE over DECODED). Every editor
# gesture the single-pane case had was gated off, painted for the wrong mode, or simply
# missing in the split one:
#
#   * `request_drag_to_cursor` / `request_select_word` returned early on `@ws_mode ||
#     @decode_kind`, so a drag selected nothing and a double-click took no word;
#   * the WS/gRPC render branches returned before `paint_request_read_chrome`, so READ mode
#     drew no caret and no selection band — an operator pressing ↓ or ⇧→ saw the screen not
#     change and read that as "the keyboard does nothing here";
#   * `render_decoded` passed `cursor: focused` unconditionally, so MESSAGES drew an INSERT
#     caret in both modes and its READ selection — the one `y` copies — was invisible;
#   * the cross-pane arrow step lived inline in `edit_move` (INS only), so a WebSocket tab —
#     which `restore` leaves in READ mode — could not reach HANDSHAKE from MESSAGES with the
#     arrows at all; and
#   * `␣Pw:KEY` was drawn by `render_request` but absent from `chrome_hit`'s badge list, so
#     the badge was a dead cell.
#
# The shared seam is `request_sub_rect` / `request_hit` / `place_request_caret` /
# `try_cross_req_pane`: the split and the single pane walk the same code now, so a fix on one
# cannot land on only one of them.
