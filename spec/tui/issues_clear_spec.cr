# `IssuesController#issues_clear` — the Issues tab's ⇧X, the fifth member of the clear-all
# family (#899: History's flows, Probe's findings, the Authorize queue, the ACTIVITY feed).
#
# The tab had no clear verb at all while the chord was documented app-wide as "one chord clears
# a tab", so ⇧X on the one list holding hand-written writeups did nothing. What is pinned here
# is the CONTRACT the shared chord carries, not just that rows go: it asks first, the prompt
# names the total, an empty project gets a toast instead of a dialog, and — the one that is
# specific to this tab — a filter narrowing the list to nothing does not turn the wipe into a
# "nothing to clear", because the count is read from the STORE and never from the visible rows.

# The CA is the slow part of standing a Session up and nothing here asserts about it.
