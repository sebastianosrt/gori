# Guards the carried patch in `src/gori/tui/paste_end_marker_patch.cr` by asserting the
# BEHAVIOUR, not the patch: a bracketed paste driven through the real `Termisu::Input::Parser`
# the way `Event::Source::Input#run_loop` drives it must end with `Key::PasteEnd`.
#
# Why behaviour and not the method: the patch reopens a PRIVATE method of a shard class. If
# upstream renames or restructures it, the reopen would quietly become a dead method here and
# the freeze would come back with nothing failing. This spec fails instead. It also keeps
# passing once shard.lock ships a fixed termisu — at which point the patch is redundant and can
# be deleted without touching this file.
#
# The freeze it stands for: no `PasteEnd` means `PasteNewline#pasting?` never clears, so
# `Runner` swallows every subsequent keystroke into a bulk insert it will never flush — the
# text never appears and the keyboard is dead while the frame keeps repainting.

# Drives the parser over a pipe with the ZERO timeout the input source uses, optionally writing a
# SECOND chunk once the end-marker window has closed.
#
# One helper rather than two near-identical ones: the only difference between the single-paste and
# the truncated-then-later-paste cases is that deferred write, and two copies of the pipe setup,
# poll loop and teardown would drift the moment either is fixed.
#
# Polls until *count* events arrive rather than *count* times — a probe that is still open yields
# nil, exactly as it does in the real loop.
#
# `later` is written after `PASTE_END_WINDOW`, read off the parser's own constant rather than
# hard-coded: the deferred write only has to outlast that window, so naming the coupling keeps the
# spec honest and lets it shrink if upstream lowers it.

# diverging from the dependency it is overriding.
#
# So pin the lock. When termisu moves, this fails and someone re-reads the patch — which is exactly
# the moment to check whether it is still needed. Assert the LOCK rather than `Termisu::VERSION`,
# which would not change for a fix on the same version number.
