# `Repeater::Minimize` had no stop seam.
#
# `RepeaterController#stop_all` (leave project / quit) and `#request_close` (^W) both did
# only `jobs.finish(...)`: the bottom-bar spinner and the run row disappeared and the
# leave-confirm reported the job stopped, while the background fiber kept issuing probes at the
# origin up to `Minimize::SEND_CAP` (250). The comment on `stop_all` conceded it —
# "Minimize has no `request_stop` seam (it is a capped, bounded probe run …), so finishing the
# job is the whole treatment here" — and that reasoning is what the fix rejects: a cap bounds a
# run, it does not end one, and a pentest tool must not keep talking to a target its operator
# believes it has disconnected from.
#
# `Minimize::Stop` is that seam, on the shape of `DiscoverRun#request_stop` → `Engine#stop`.
# It is checked immediately BEFORE every send, in both phases of the run.
#
# These examples drive the engine directly — no Host, no socket — because the engine is where
# the stop has to be OBSERVED. The controller's two call sites are asserted in
# repeater_refusal_inline_spec.cr, which already stands up a Host + Session.

# A `Fuzz::Backend` that counts calls and answers with one frozen response, so calibration
# succeeds, every variant reads as "unchanged", and every candidate would be removed if the run
# were allowed to walk all of them. `on_send` runs after the count, which is how an example
# stops the run from inside a specific send.
