# The open-time token-grammar re-spelling, as the OPERATOR hears about it (#env.syntax).
#
# Nothing asks: a project whose stored tokens are spelled in the grammar this install has left is
# re-spelled the first time it opens, and every surface then REPORTS it. The wording is one builder
# (`EnvMigration::StoreReport#line`) so the three surfaces cannot drift into describing the same
# event differently, and the wirings that carry it are pinned by grep — a `Runner` is not
# constructible from a spec, which is exactly how a dead announcement would ship.
