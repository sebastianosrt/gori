# It carries its OWN pin rather than leaning on `paste_end_marker_spec.cr`'s. That spec exists
# to be deleted — it is the trigger for the other carried patch, and the day termisu ships the
# paste fix, that file and its pin go with it. This patch would then have silently lost its only
# guard, which is the failure the pin exists to prevent.

  # The patch reopens `Termisu::Event::Source::Input` and overrides a PRIVATE method, so no spec
  # can call it. What a spec can see is that the reopen is compiled in at all: these two
  # constants exist nowhere in termisu, so their presence pins that the file is required and
  # applied. A rename upstream would leave them defined with a dead `run_loop` beside them —
  # which is what the lock pin above is for.
  # The pin above catches an upstream FIX to the same method. This catches the other half: an
  # upstream RESTRUCTURE, which leaves the override as a silent overload nobody calls. That is
  # exactly what the #1125 bump did — `run_loop` grew two parameters and the back-off vanished
  # with no compile error and no failing example — so compare the signature the patch overrides
  # against the one the installed shard defines.
