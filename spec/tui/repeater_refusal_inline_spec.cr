# A REFUSED repeater send used to be handed to the same channel a background send fiber uses:
#
#     results.send({view, Repeater::Result.new(Bytes.new(0), nil, nil, 0_i64, reason)})
#
# — a bare, BLOCKING `Channel#send` made from the UI fiber, into an 8-slot buffer whose only
# CONSUMER is that same fiber. `Runner#drain_results` runs only after `drain_burst`, which
# handles up to `CHAR_DRAIN_CAP` (65_536) coalesceable events before returning, and Enter IS
# coalesceable (it carries `char: '\r'`). So a ninth refusal inside one input burst parked the
# whole TUI inside `Channel#send`: no input, no render, no drain, terminal left in raw/alt mode
# — while the proxy kept capturing on other fibers, so the process still looked alive. The
# trigger is ordinary: a tab whose target is refused (Sandbox on, or an EXCLUDE rule) plus a
# ten-line paste into the response pane, since `PasteNewline` drops only the LF of each CR-LF
# pair. The refusal path also returns BEFORE `view.inflight = true`, so the one-in-flight guard
# never engaged and every Enter re-entered the send.
#
# The asymmetry was the proof of intent: the three BACKGROUND sends beside these already used
# `select/when…/else` with "drop the late result instead of blocking this fiber forever". Only
# the three UI-fiber refusals were bare.
#
# The fix applies the refusal INLINE (`RepeaterController#apply_refusal`) — it never left the
# fiber that owns view state, so the channel round-trip bought nothing and cost the deadlock.
# Dropping it under `select/else` would have been the wrong trade the other way: a late result
# is redundant, a refusal is the operator's only proof the send did not happen.

# The narrow shell facade a controller is given. Everything here is inert except `session`,
# `jobs`, `notifications` and `status` — the only members the send paths touch — because a
# controller can reach the shell ONLY through this module, so stubbing it is stubbing the
# entire shell.
