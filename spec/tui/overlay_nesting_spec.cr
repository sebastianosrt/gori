# `Overlay#on_close` — the nested-modal seam (#355). A modal opened FROM another pops back
# into it on close, which the shell used to express with a single `@prefs_return` flag plus
# a `settle_sub_editor` call at each dispatch chokepoint: one hard-coded relationship for
# the whole app, and one the Preferences family alone could use.
#
# Everything the migration batches need from it is a CONTRACT about shell state, not about
# any one modal, so this file pins the contract with doubles and no production overlay:
#
#   * on_close runs on a cancel and on a commit that closed — never while the modal is up
#   * the shell drops the modal BEFORE running it, so a pop-back's open_overlay sticks
#   * the parent it restores may be a migrated `Overlay` OR an unmigrated `@overlay` state
#   * `leave_overlay` deliberately skips it, for an exit that goes somewhere else (^P)
#
# The last three are what a confirm raised from INSIDE another modal needs — the three
# live sites being `runner.cr`'s settings ^R reset and tab-bar reset (migrated parents) and
# `history_controller.cr:385`'s delete-from-detail (an unmigrated `:detail` parent).
