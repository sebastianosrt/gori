# The TUI's half of the freeze drift gate (#1038). A Repeater tab whose request was edited
# after its stored response arrived freezes a pair that never happened — the one thing frozen
# evidence exists not to produce. The headless surfaces REFUSE it; the TUI has an operator
# looking at the tab, so it asks, and the copy is still available to anyone who means it.
#
# `Runner.new` owns a terminal and appears nowhere under spec/, so the card is driven through
# the seam the Runner opens it from (`Runner.drift_confirm`) and the chaining around it is
# pinned by reading the source. Comments are stripped first: a comment explaining a rule
# contains the tokens the rule looks for.
