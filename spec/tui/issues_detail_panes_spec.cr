# The Issues detail is TWO panes, and until now it neither looked like two nor navigated like
# two.
#
# RELATED was an open region — an `inner_divider`, a text heading, then the link rows — sitting
# above the closed NOTES card, which reads as containment. Nothing in that region varied with
# `@detail_focus` either: the divider took the pane-level `focused`, the row band took the
# selected INDEX, the heading was unconditional. So `esc` out of NOTES moved focus somewhere
# with no signal at all — and on an issue with NO links, which is the shape `n` creates, there
# was not even a band to notice. That is why "back doesn't work" was a fair report of a key
# that did exactly what it was written to do.
#
# The third defect is the one that actually strands the keyboard: `pane_advance` answered false
# while a detail was open, which is how a view tells `Runner#focus_advance` to hand focus to
# the TAB BAR — and the shell's `handle_detail_key` arm is gated on `@focus == :body`. One ⇥
# and the detail was still fully drawn with every key dead, back keys included.
