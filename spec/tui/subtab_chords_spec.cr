# CONTRACT: `^N` / `^W` create and close a sub-tab from ANY focus level, on every tab that
# has a strip — the same `subtab_new` / `subtab_close` contract the strip's own handler runs.
#
# They were per-tab guards before, and the coverage was ragged in a way nothing announced:
# `^N` answered on Repeater/Fuzzer/Notes (three hardcoded arms in `Runner#handle_key`), while
# `^W` answered from the strip, or from whichever of the six controllers had grown its own
# arm — so a Fuzzer/Miner/Sequencer BODY had no close at all. Since #1055 the space menu draws
# the chord beside the row it belongs to, which turns a ragged guard into an advertised dead
# key. One guard in the shell, routed through the two contract methods, is the fix.
#
# Asserted against the SOURCE because the alternative is standing up a Runner (a terminal, a
# session, nine controllers) to press two keys; the shape of the guard is the whole claim.
