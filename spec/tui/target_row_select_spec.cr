# The TARGET row — the single-line URL (and SNI) field at the top of the Repeater and Fuzzer
# — is a READ pane like any other: a caret, an anchor, a painted band, `LineFieldRead`
# behind all three. It had ⇧←/→ and two holes around them.
#
# ⇧Home / ⇧End. `target_home` / `target_end` ASSIGNED the caret, which never reaches the
# anchor living in `@target_read` — so the two keys that should have grown a selection to the
# edge of the value DROPPED it instead. This is the same defect #583 fixed in
# `TextArea#home`/`#end_of_line`, left standing on the one field that is not a TextArea.
#
# THE POINTER. `handle_drag` / `handle_double_click` listed `:request` and `:response` and
# not `:target`, so the field an operator most often wants to lift a slice out of (the URL)
# could be clicked but never dragged across. A bare press also assigned the caret directly,
# leaving a stale anchor behind: clicking away from a ⇧←/→ selection repainted the band from
# the OLD anchor to the new caret.
#
# Both views carry the same field, so every example runs against both.
