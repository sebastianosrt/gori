# #1090 layer four's second half: a pending operator message rides back on the next gori tool
# result, for the clients that have no live route at all (grok, pi, hermes, Antigravity, Claude
# Desktop — surveyed, none has a door a server can knock on). The poll tool still exists; this
# is what makes the poll layer work when the model never remembers to call it.
#
# The load-bearing parts are the ones that decide whether a message can be LOST or REPEATED:
# the floor (nothing said before this session is replayed), the cursor (nothing is attached
# twice), the CARRIED filter (a socket delivery retires it here too), and the addressing (a
# message for another session's pid is not this session's to read).
