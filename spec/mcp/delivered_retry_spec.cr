# `Repeater::Result#delivered?` is the one bit that separates "safe to send again" from "the
# origin already has this request and has acted on it". Both engines compute it; until this
# spec it reached NO surface (`grep -rn '"delivered"' src/` was empty), so MCP answered
# `retryable: true` for exactly the failures the engines flag as delivered — and an agent
# driving a POST doubled the side effect.
#
# The complements matter as much as the cases: a plain silent origin and a plain connect
# refusal MUST stay retryable, or the fix has traded one wrong answer for another.
