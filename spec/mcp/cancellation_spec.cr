# `notifications/cancelled` STOPS THE WORK (#1103).
#
# Before this, a cancellation bought silence and nothing else: the response was suppressed and
# the tool ran to completion. For `probe_scan{active:true}` that meant a client which had
# stopped waiting still had real attack probes sent on its behalf, up to
# `PROBE_ACTIVE_MAX_FLOWS` flows of them — the resource gori was failing to free was a third
# party's server.
#
# So the examples here count requests at an origin rather than asserting a flag was set. A
# spec that checked the predicate was consulted would pass against the bug.

# A loopback origin that answers everything and counts request lines. `on_hit` fires with the
# running count, on the serving fiber, which is how an example makes the cancellation land
# MID-SCAN without timing anything.
