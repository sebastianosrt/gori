# What the MCP catalogue costs a client, and the guide's account of it (#1137).
#
# An MCP client loads every advertised tool into the model's context before the first
# question and keeps it there for the session, so the size of `tools/list` is a product
# number, not an implementation detail. Every place gori ever wrote it down had drifted by
# the time #1137 measured it: the guide said "about 160 tools" and "--read-only cuts it to 53"
# of a 179/62 registry, the `--tools` help and two comments said ~43k tokens of a catalogue
# that had grown past 200 KB. So the numbers now live in exactly one checked place — the
# guide's table — and this file is the check: a row whose count is wrong, or whose size is
# off by more than SIZE_TOLERANCE, fails with the row it should say instead.
