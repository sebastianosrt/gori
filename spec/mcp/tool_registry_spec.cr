# The tool registry is generated from the `@[Tool]` annotations on the handlers
# (src/gori/mcp/tool.cr, and the `macro finished` block in tools.cr). These examples pin
# the two contracts the generation is trusted for, by DRIVING every tool through the real
# `Tools#call` rather than by reading the constants back:
#
#   1. tools/list and the dispatcher name the same set — a tool an agent can see is one it
#      can call, and a tool it can call is one it was told about;
#   2. the flag on a handler is the gate the call actually meets — `gated:` is refused
#      under --read-only before the handler runs, and everything not `unbound:` is refused
#      with NO_PROJECT while no project is bound.
#
# Every call below is made with EMPTY arguments. That is what keeps a sweep over every tool
# safe: a gated tool is refused before its handler runs, an unbound-refused tool likewise,
# and a read tool handed nothing either lists an empty project or refuses the missing
# argument. It is also why the non-gated arm asserts "not INTERNAL": an empty argument
# hash is the operator's mistake, and `Tools#call` promises to code that INVALID_ARGUMENT
# (or a tool-specific NOT_FOUND), never as a server crash.
