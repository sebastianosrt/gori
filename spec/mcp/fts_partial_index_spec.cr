# Two ways the MCP surface used to answer a question it had not actually got to ask, both of
# them reachable only with a second gori on the same project — which is the normal deployment
# (a TUI capturing, an agent driving `gori mcp` beside it).
#
#   * `drain_fts_or_error` drained the off-commit trigram index (Store V4) and returned nil
#     unconditionally on a WRITABLE store. But `index_pending!` reports a batch that lost
#     SQLite's single writer slot as "0 indexed" and takes its `break if n == 0` there — that
#     contract is deliberate (a contended write must never hang capture) and it means the drain
#     RETURNS with rows still dirty. So `body:` answered off a partial index, and an agent got
#     "2 flows" with nothing saying the other 40 were never looked at. The read-only branch has
#     always refused exactly this; the writable branch is the same silence by the other door.
#   * `send_request` raised `Gori::Error` when the History row would not commit, and the tool's
#     own rescue codes that INVALID_ARGUMENT — "fix your arguments" for a call whose arguments
#     were fine. An agent's error policy rewrites the request instead of retrying it.
#
# The peer connection here stands in for that second gori: SQLite locks per CONNECTION, so one
# pool holding BEGIN IMMEDIATE is the same contention a second process produces. `busy_timeout=1`
# is what makes these examples fast — the real 5 s wait is the thing being skipped, not tested.
# Shape borrowed from spec/store/concurrent_writer_recovery_spec.cr, which proves the store-level
# halves (`insert_flow` answers 0, `index_pending!` answers 0 with the backlog intact).
