# `send_request{record_history:true}` must record THE REQUEST THAT WENT OUT.
#
# The tool's own comment states the invariant ("before the scope gate + History write so the
# recorded/effective request == the wire"), and it held for everything the plan builder does.
# It did not hold for the SEND SEAM — `Sender#send`'s `$NAME` binding pass and the ACTIVE
# SESSION SLOT's header overlay ran inside `plan.send`, out of sight of the recorder, which
# wrote `plan.bytes`: the draft the seam started from.
#
# So a send made as slot `admin` reached the origin with `Authorization: Bearer …` and was
# recorded without it. That flow is then the agent's evidence — the id it hands to
# `get_flow`, `compare_flows`, `probe_scan`, or a fuzz seed — and every one of them was
# reading a request nobody sent, missing exactly the identity that produced the response
# beside it.
#
# The origin here keeps the bytes it actually received, so the assertion is the invariant
# itself rather than a restatement of the fix: recorded head == received head.
