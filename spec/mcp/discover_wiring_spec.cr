# authenticated sweep ran unauthenticated over the whole authenticated surface and reported
# "found nothing", with no error anywhere. `gori run discover` aborts by name; MCP is the
# surface where nobody is watching stderr.

# ── 2. discover's incomplete_reason comes from the ENGINE ─────────────────────────────────

# Two round-3 fixes met here from opposite sides: one added `queued` + `incomplete_reason` to

# left INFERRING the reason from `queued > 0`, and the engine's own predicate is
# `cap_reached? && (frontier non-empty || refused > 0)` — deliberately two clauses, because a
# Calibrate task whose probes were all refused consumes no frontier entry. So a sweep that
# spent its whole budget before a single wordlist candidate was tried drained the frontier to
# EMPTY and came back `status:"done", job_complete:true, has_more:false`, which an agent reads
# as an exhaustive directory sweep and stops looking.
