# `instructions` is the first thing the model reads, and it is read as FACT. A sentence that
# names a tool `tools/list` does not carry sends the agent to call something that answers
# "unknown tool" — and under `--tools` this text used to do exactly that, starting with its
# very first instruction ("Call ql_reference before writing queries") on a server that
# advertised no ql_reference.
#
# The mechanism was already here: the operator-messages note asked `advertises?`. It simply
# never reached the rest of the text.

# Every tool name the instructions can spell. A name added to the prose without being added
# here is not checked, so keep the two together — that is what this file is for.
