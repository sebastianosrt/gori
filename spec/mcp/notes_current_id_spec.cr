# `list_notes` published `Notes::Doc#cur` — a 0-based INDEX — as a bare top-level `cur`, in a
# payload where every other number is an id and where every note tool (`get_note`,
# `update_note`, `delete_note`) is addressed BY id. On a five-note document whose fourth entry
# is open that read `{"cur":3, …}` while the open note was `id:4` — and `id:3` was a different
# note `get_note` would happily return. `Notes.merge` reached the same conclusion internally
# ("the active note arrives as `cur_id`, a STABLE ID, not as an index"); this projection was
# the last place still handing out the index. The CLI twin never had the ambiguity: `gori run
# notes --format json` names `id` and `index` on every row.
