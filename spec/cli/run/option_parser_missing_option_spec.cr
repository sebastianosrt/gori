# Every parser under `src/gori/cli/` that takes a `=VALUE` flag, as a CLASS.
#
# `OptionParser`'s default `missing_option` handler RAISES `OptionParser::MissingOption`. That
# is neither `Gori::Error` nor a broken-pipe `IO::Error` (the only two `CLI.run` rescues,
# src/gori/cli.cr), so a value flag left bare at the
# end of argv — `gori run rewriter rm 1 --project`, or an unset `--project "$P"` in a wrapper
# script — reaches `main` and prints a Crystal backtrace instead of a one-line abort:
#
#   gori run rewriter rm 1 --project      → Unhandled exception: Missing option: --project
#   gori run colormarker move 1 --db      → same
#   gori run decoder list --format        → same
#
# `unknown_args` does not absorb it: the token matches a DECLARED option, so `handle_flag` runs
# first. src/gori/cli/run/oast.cr fixed one parser for exactly this and read as the only one;
# eleven more were carrying the same hole. Asserted over the SOURCE rather than per-command,
# the way the `unknown_args` guard in spec/cli_spec.cr is, because the defect is one a new
# subcommand reintroduces by copying the idiom from its neighbours — which is how these got it.
#
# A parser declaring no `=VALUE` flag cannot hit the handler, so it is exempt rather than
# force-fitted.
