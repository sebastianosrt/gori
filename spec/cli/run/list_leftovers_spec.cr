# `CLI::Run.list_leftover_error` — the one seam behind `refuse_list_leftovers`, which twelve
# `gori run` dispatchers call.
#
# The failure it exists for: every one of those dispatchers routes a first token starting
# with '-' straight to its LIST command, on the assumption that the rest are list options.
# So `gori run rewriter --project=t1 rm 1` — the flag-first ordering every other `gori run`
# command accepts — discarded `rm 1`, listed the rules, and exited 0. A destructive mutation
# that silently no-ops with a SUCCESS status is the worst thing a scripted surface can do,
# and a script cannot see it: the exit code says the delete happened.
#
# `abort` is not spec-able, which is exactly why the DECISION and the MESSAGE were split out
# into this function. Everything below drives it directly.

  # `positional = before + after` on the callback line, `positional.first?` twenty lines down,
  # nothing in between. So the rule follows the SINK instead of the spelling: whatever variable
