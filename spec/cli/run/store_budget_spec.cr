# Which SQLite wait budget a `gori run` subcommand opens its project with.
#
# `open_store` is the one door every subcommand uses, and #1118 gave it a one-second busy /
# checkout budget on the premise that a CLI invocation is one-shot. Six of them are not: a
# crawl, a sweep, a HAR stream, a scan, a retest and a listen keep the handle open for the whole
# run and write through it as they go. Measured against a peer holding `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, the
# one-second budget refused those writes too — a dropped batch of findings, not a fast exit.
# Those callers now say `long_running: true` and keep the Store's own defaults.
#
# The choice is pinned as a pure function plus the wiring, rather than by timing a contended
# open: the timing is SQLite's, and a spec that sleeps five seconds to prove a constant is the
# wrong trade.
