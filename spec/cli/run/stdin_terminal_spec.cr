# The seam every stdin door in `gori run` shares (#1034): a road that reads operator bytes
# from stdin because a FLAG named it — `--request-stdin`, `--notes-stdin`, the four that spell
# stdin `-`, and a `--…-file` PATH that resolves to a terminal — reads a PIPE or a REDIRECT,
# and refuses a TERMINAL.
#
# It mirrors no single source file, so it lives beside the other cross-subcommand seams under
# spec/cli/run/ (`list_leftovers_spec.cr`, `fuzz_args_spec.cr`) rather than next to one door.
#
# What a terminal does that a pipe does not, and why none of it is survivable here:
#   * it ECHOES the bytes back, so a raw request's `Authorization`/`Cookie` lands in the
#     scrollback and, under a PTY-driven harness, in the captured transcript — the very
#     exposure `--request-stdin` exists to close for argv and shell history;
#   * `^D` FLUSHES the pending line rather than ending the read, so a request with no trailing
#     newline needs two and a driver that sends one hangs;
#   * `MAX_CANON` truncates a long header line before gori sees an octet.

# A real terminal file descriptor. Opening the pty multiplexer allocates a master, and
# `isatty(3)` is true for it on both Linux and Darwin — so the terminal arm is driven for
# real rather than stubbed behind an interface the production code does not use.
#
# nil where there is no usable one: `/dev/ptmx` can be absent, unopenable (a hardened image,
# or one at its pty limit) or present-but-not-a-pty (the node bind-mounted over, devpts not
# mounted). All three must reach `pending` rather than a red example blaming the guard — but
# `tty?` is checked HERE, not assumed from a successful open, or a `/dev/ptmx` that is really
# a regular file would run the terminal examples and fail them for being right.
