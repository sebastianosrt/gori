# `--db PATH` and `--project NAME` are the same question — WHICH project — and `--db` used to
# win in silence. So `gori run history --db "$DB" --project "$PROJ"` read `$DB` and exited 0
# with a `$PROJ` that need not have existed at all: never resolved, never checked, never
# mentioned. On a read that only misleads. `history delete -q … --yes`, `history clear --yes`
# and `project delete` take the SAME pair, and there the invisible winner decides which
# project gets emptied.
#
# The sentence is asserted rather than the abort, for the reason `colormarker_rule_row` and
# `view_row` are public: `refuse_two_targets` ends in `abort`, and a spec cannot drive a call
# that exits the process.
