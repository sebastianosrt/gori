# argv is whatever bytes the OS handed us — Crystal builds those Strings without validating
# UTF-8 — and `split_ql_negations` matched a PCRE2 regex straight against them. PCRE2 does not
# fail to match on a bad subject, it RAISES `ArgumentError: Regex match error: UTF-8 error`,
# and `CLI.run` (rescues a broken pipe and Gori::Error) does not catch
# that, so `gori run history $'\xff'` printed a Crystal backtrace out of `main` before any
# store was even opened. Reachable from a plain shell, and realistically from a wrapper script
# interpolating a latin-1 term captured off the wire.
#
# The remedy is the one `read_token_list` in src/gori/cli/run/sequence.cr already uses: scrub
# the SUBJECT of the match, never the value. What gets pushed into the returned arrays is the
# original `a`, so the operator's query bytes reach QL exactly as typed (P7) — the assertions
# below check both halves, because scrubbing the stored value would be the easy wrong fix.
#
# The two sibling sites, `parse_duration` (`--for`) and `parse_numbers` (`--numbers`), took the
# same one-word change, but both end in `abort` on a value that does not match and so cannot be
# exercised in-process; `split_ql_negations` returns, so it carries the behavioural pin.
