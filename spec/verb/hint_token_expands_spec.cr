# CONTRACT: every `{verb.id}` token a hint carries actually EXPANDS.
#
# `Hotkeys.expand` resolves a token to the chord that verb is bound to, and when it cannot it
# leaves the token ALONE — the deliberate fallback for a render that has no registry. On a
# footer strip that fallback is not graceful degradation, it is the literal string
# `{fuzz.sort} sort` printed into the status line, curly braces and all, for a verb that has
# no chord because it is MENU-ONLY by decision (verbs/history.cr, key audit F2). The operator
# then presses the only key the line names — `o` — and gets "nothing bound here".
#
# Two ways to fail, and the spec names them apart because the fixes differ: a token naming no
# verb at all is a typo or a rename that missed a caller; a token naming a real verb with no
# chord is a hint promising a key the key budget deliberately did not spend. That one belongs
# in the menu spelling, `{space:fuzz.sort} sort` (see the contract at the foot of this file).
#
# Source-scanned, like `layering_spec`: the templates live in string literals inside `case`
# arms that no roster can reach, so reading them off disk is the only way to see them all.

# CONTRACT (#1274): a space-menu letter in UI text comes from the registry.
#
# A hand-typed `space → t` is checked by nothing, and letters move — the Help sheet printed
# three wrong ones, the Sitemap filter dropdown said `T` for a Tag path that is `m`, and a
# toast still named `b` only by luck. Text that names a menu row spells it `{space:verb.id}`
# (Hotkeys.expand / Hotkeys.expand_menu_paths), which reads the verb's `menu_key`. Naming the
# row by its TITLE ("space → Mine parameters") is fine: that names no letter.
#
# Comment lines are skipped the way the scan above skips them; a comment may say what a key
# is today, and it is not drawn.
# Hand-spelled letters this spec found in a file another change owns, each an exact
# {file, stripped line}. Not a standing exception: the spelling is still wrong the day the
# letter moves. The scan fails when a line stops matching, so the fix deletes its entry.
