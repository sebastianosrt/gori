# Byte-fidelity regressions for the bare-LF / mixed-EOL blind spots in `Fuzz::ContentLength`.
# The module's contract is byte-level and zero-allocation (content_length.cr:11-16); these
# specs pin the exact wire bytes, because the whole point of a smuggling/desync primitive is
# that ONE hidden byte changes how a downstream parser frames the message.

  # ADDING a header is held to a higher bar than recomputing one, and `Transfer-Encoding` is
  # where the two come apart. `chunked?` answers "is the FINAL coding chunked" (RFC 7230
  # §3.3.1), which is right for leaving an existing Content-Length alone — but it reads
  # `chunked, gzip` as NOT chunked and looks only at the FIRST TE header, so using it to gate
  # the ADD path would let gori invent a Content-Length beside a TE line. That pair is the
  # canonical CL+TE smuggling primitive, and here it would be one the operator never wrote,
  # manufactured on every request of a sweep. `FlowRequest.resync_content_length` refuses on
  # any `transfer-encoding:` line; this is the same rule in the fuzz module.
