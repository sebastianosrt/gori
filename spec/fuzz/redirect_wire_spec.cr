# The bytes the fuzzer's redirect follower actually puts on a socket (#397).
#
# A spec that asserted on the resolved path STRING would prove nothing here — that was #390's
# lesson. Every layer between the `Location` header and the request line preserves a raw SP or
# TAB happily (the response codec strips only the OWS around a field-value, and `URI.parse`
# validates neither `path` nor `query`), so the forged request line stays invisible until it is
# assembled. These examples read it back off a real TCP connection instead, and COUNT request
# lines rather than parsing the first one.

# A recording origin. Answers each connection with the next canned response (repeating the last
# once they run out, with `{PORT}` substituted so a response can name the listener itself) and
# returns the raw bytes of every connection it accepted, in order.

# origin breaks lines on either (RFC 7230 §3.5). And the target is matched with `.+`, not `\S+`:

  # only, and a field-value is stripped at its ends, so a BARE LF or bare CR sits in the parsed
  # `Location` verbatim. `obfuscated_header?` would catch it, but the RESPONSE path deliberately
  # gates on the narrower `framing_ambiguous?` instead, so that a legacy origin does not 502.
  #
  # That narrowness is what leaves this reachable. A poisoned `Location` IS refused before the
  # follower when its smuggled lines change how the response frames — a blank line, or a
  # `Content-Length:` line, makes the strict and lenient views disagree and `Repeater::Engine`
