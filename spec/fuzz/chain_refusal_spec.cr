# `§value¦chain§` naming a converter the run cannot apply must refuse the PLAN, not quietly
# put the raw payload on the wire.
#
# `Template#apply_chains` returns the payload verbatim when its chain does not run, arguing
# that a streaming fuzz run has nowhere to surface a per-position error. That was written when
# the only way to reach it was a typo. The saved-chain library added a class that is not a
# typo: a name the operator saved, that the `^Q` autocomplete offers and `gori run decoder
# list` prints as an ordinary converter, and that the library registered as an always-raising
# step precisely so the failure would be VISIBLE. Reproduced on the wire: five marked
# positions, three naming such a chain, all three carrying the plaintext payload under
# `1 sent · 0 errors`, `"error":null`, `"matched":true`, while `gori run decoder` named the
# identical refusal off the identical registry.
