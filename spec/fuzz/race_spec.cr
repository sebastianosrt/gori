# ── on the count assertions below ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The RaceOrigin dials N localhost connections in a burst; under scheduler starvation (a loaded
# CI runner, most sharply on the 1.21.0 job) the OS resets or times out SOME of them before the
# single-fiber accept loop reaches them — "Connection reset by peer" / "Broken pipe" / "Read
# timed out". That is the harness artifact the "tight absolute release spread" comment already
# documents (the real timing was measured out-of-process), not a code defect, and it is not
# rare: a small runner was observed serving only 4 of 8. So these specs assert the BEHAVIOUR as
# one-sided invariants that hold no matter how many connections the harness drops — a warm-up
# ALWAYS precedes its race request, a dial failure NEVER aborts the surviving group, a group of
# <2 releases NOTHING — rather than an exact survivor count the harness cannot guarantee. The
# counts the engine itself controls (one Result per job, indices 0..N-1, `sent == N`) stay
# exact, because those never touch the network. A genuine regression violates the invariant on
# every run, load or none (verified against removing the last-byte hold-back).
