# `Proxy::SocketResidue.state`, asked at `ConnPool` checkout, is the question asked of every parked socket right before a
# request is written onto it: is anything waiting, and is the peer still there. It answers on
# two very different paths — an fd-level MSG_PEEK for a plaintext TCPSocket, and a timed read
# probe for TLS, where OpenSSL hides the fd and residue can sit in its DECRYPTED buffer where
# a raw peek cannot see it.
#
# Only the plaintext path had coverage. The TLS branch is the one that costs (measured: a
# clean TLS checkout is ~1.6 ms against 0.38 µs for plaintext, because it pays the whole
# DRAIN_PROBE deadline), so it is the one anybody optimising this will touch — with nothing
# failing if they get it wrong. These pin all three answers on BOTH transports first.
