# Seeds a "demo" registry project with a realistic, varied dataset so every tab in
# the TUI has something real to explore:
#
#   History / Target(Sitemap+Discover) / Issues / Notes / Scope       — captured traffic
#   Repeater / Fuzzer / Miner / Sequencer                             — pre-seeded workbench sessions
#   Rewriter                                                          — match&replace rules + session bindings
#   Colormarker                                                       — History row-colour rules
#   OAST                                                              — an out-of-band listener with callbacks
#   Probe                                                             — passive scan + active findings + custom rules
#   Decoder                                                           — pre-loaded conversion sub-tabs
#   Authorize                                                         — the identities (session slots) to replay as
#   Env (bindings)                                                    — project env vars a Repeater tab uses
#
# The JWT and Comparer tabs keep NO per-project state, so nothing can be seeded into them.
# Their material is one keystroke away instead: the Decoder's `session JWT` sub-tab holds the
# token, and History's space menu sends any flow to either tab.
#
# The captured traffic covers every PROTO label History can print — HTTP/HTTPS, WS/WSS,
# GRPC/GRPCS, SSE/SSES and a short-circuited STUB — over both transports, plus the shapes
# that are not a clean 200: an RFC 8441 extended CONNECT, a `connect-udp` tunnel, MQTT and
# graphql-transport-ws over a socket, gRPC server streaming / trailers-only failures /
# grpc-web / a body cut mid-frame, a gzip'd chunked body, and flows in Pending, Aborted and
# Error state. See the "Act three" section for the whole list.
#
# It also covers every METHOD a real client sends — the eight RFC 9110 registers, the ten
# WebDAV/DeltaV/DASL adds, and the three a hunter's own tooling puts on the wire — against
# the hosts, paths, statuses, sizes and durations that stress a fixed-width column: a
# 15-character verb, a punycode and a homograph host, a double-width path, a right-to-left
# run, a zero-width space, a body the capture cap cut at 2 KB of 2.5 GB, and a 3.5-hour long
# poll. That is the "Act five" section, and it exists to be LOOKED AT: a rendering defect in
# a column is not something a spec can assert, only something a demo can show.
#
# "Act six" carries that exercise into the lists that are NOT History — a colour rule, a
# rewrite rule, a binding, a sitemap tag, a Repeater tab and two issues named in Hangul or
# Hebrew, because a row of user text laid out by hand is a column too. It also fills the
# three panes that used to open empty: the Repeater's stored RESPONSE (including one send
# that never connected), the saved-view library, and the Authorize identity list.
#
#   crystal run scripts/seed_demo.cr
#
# Re-runnable: it wipes any existing "demo" project first, then recreates it.

#   * every label the History PROTO column can print, not just the TLS spellings: WS and

#     an RFC 8441 extended CONNECT (a WebSocket over HTTP/2: answered 200, never 101), an
#     extended CONNECT that is NOT a WebSocket (`connect-udp`), and a gRPC call answered by
#     a proxy's `text/html` 502 (still gRPC — the REQUEST said so);
#   * the framings whose RENDERING is the thing worth checking: server streaming, a grpc-web
#     trailer frame, a body cut mid-frame, a gzip'd chunked body, and a socket carrying
#     control frames, a fragmented message and an unmasked client frame;
#   * application protocols that are not HTTP at all and ride a WebSocket to get here: MQTT
#     (binary frames) and graphql-transport-ws (which lights up the GRAPHQL pane on a flow
#     that has no request body to decode);
#   * the flow STATES a clean capture never produces — Error, Aborted, and a response gori

# `api.demo.test`, tabs called "XSS PoC". A list that has never been given a Hangul
# name has never had its width arithmetic tested, and that arithmetic is exactly what
# a demo can show and a spec cannot guess at.
#

# RESPONSE pane, the History view library, and the Authorize identity list — because

#

# `_error` / `_duration_us`), and the tab restores it on open — so a seeded tab can
# arrive already answered instead of reading "— not sent — press ^R to resend —". That
# is what gives `d:diff`, `^X:hex` and `p:pretty` something to work on before the
# operator has sent anything, and it is the only way the demo shows a repeater send that

# Demo engagement — recon notes

## Hosts
- shop.demo.test    — storefront (HTML)
- api.demo.test     — JSON API (/v1)
- cdn.demo.test     — static assets (EXCLUDED from scope — CDN noise)
- auth.demo.test    — OAuth 2.0 / OIDC authorization server
- legacy.demo.test  — the old stack: Flask, Django and Rack apps, plus :8080 metrics
- www.hahwul.com    — REAL, live site (replayable)

## Auth
- POST /api/login -> bearer token (ALSO leaked in JSON body, not just cookie)
- token used as `Authorization: Bearer ...` on /v1/*
- the token is a real HS256 JWT — weakly signed (see the JWT lead below)
- there is a SECOND auth path: OAuth code flow on auth.demo.test → /oauth/token
  returns access_token + id_token (a different JWT) + refresh_token
- legacy.demo.test runs framework-signed session cookies instead (Flask/Django/Rack)

## Leads
- [x] reflected XSS on /search?q=
- [x] IDOR on /v1/users/{id}  (customer token reads admin's PII)
- [x] blind SSRF on POST /v1/import  (confirmed out-of-band, see OAST tab)
- [x] JWT signed with a guessable secret  (crack + re-forge in the JWT tab)
- [x] Flask/Django cookies signed with the same weak secret (Decoder → `cookie-decode`)
- [x] CORS reflects any Origin WITH credentials on /v1/cart
- [x] /.env served in the clear (DB + mail passwords, APP_KEY)
- [x] open redirect on /go?next=  — chains with the OAuth redirect_uri
- [x] source map + an inline postgres:// DSN in the production bundle
- [x] verbose 500 on /v1/debug
- [ ] check /admin (403) for auth bypass / header tricks
- [ ] enumerate /v1/users/{id} range (Fuzzer session "user id enum" is staged)
- [ ] replay the OAuth code — is it single-use? ("oauth code entropy" sequencer is staged)

## Where these flows came from
The SRC column says who put each request on the wire, and everything without a tag is
`PROXY` — traffic this target's own client sent through gori. Five rows are not:

- `RPTR` twice — the same IDOR probe re-sent by hand from the Repeater tab and by an agent
  through MCP `send_request`. Same tool, different surface; open either and the request pane
  ends with `sent by gori — repeater (tui)` / `(mcp)` and the repeater session it came from.
- `FUZZ` — one hit out of the "path traversal" sweep, recorded because the run asked for
  evidence. The `.env` it returns is real, but the PAYLOAD is gori's: reading this row without
  the SRC column would be reading your own request back as a finding.
- `CRAWL` — a Discover fetch. Crawls have been persisted by default since the tab shipped.
- `IMPRT` — read out of `partner-webhooks.har`, not sent by gori at all. That is why
  `src:gori` leaves it out while `-src:proxy` keeps it.

`src:` takes the long tokens and the column's short tags alike (`src:rptr` = `src:repeater`),
and `source:` is accepted as a synonym. A flow captured before gori recorded provenance shows
`—` and falls out of `src:` in BOTH directions, the way a Pending flow falls out of `status:`
and `-status:`. This project is freshly seeded, so it holds no such row.

## Protocols on this target
Sort History by the PROTO column (or filter `proto:ws` / `proto:grpc` / `proto:sse`) — every
label the column can print is in here, cleartext spellings included.

- **WebSocket** GET /ws/chat (101) — open it and switch to the MESSAGES pane (→ sent, ← received).
  Three more sockets sit beside it:
  - `ws://legacy.demo.test:8080/ws/notify` — CLEARTEXT (`WS`, not `WSS`), and it puts the
    session JWT in its first frame. Its transcript also carries an unmasked client frame, a
    3-fragment message, PING/PONG, an RSV1 probe, a `[gori]` advisory row and a CLOSE with a code.
  - `CONNECT /ws/notifications` — a WebSocket over HTTP/2 (RFC 8441): no 101 anywhere, just an
    extended CONNECT answered 200. The `X-Gori-Protocol: websocket` marker line is what makes it a
    WebSocket; the FRAMES pane holds the h2 frames underneath.
  - `/mqtt` — MQTT, an application protocol that is not HTTP at all, tunnelled through a socket.
    Every frame is binary; the handshake's `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: mqtt` is what names the bytes.
  - `/graphql` (101) — a graphql-transport-ws SUBSCRIPTION. The document travels inside a frame,
    so this flow has no body to decode and still offers a GRAPHQL pane.
- **gRPC** POST /demo.Greeter/SayHello (HTTP/2) — FRAMES pane shows the raw h2 frame log;
  the application/grpc body deframes into length-prefixed protobuf messages (a schema-less
  wire-format tree — `p` toggles it back to hex). Five more, each a different shape:
  - `/demo.Prices/Watch` — SERVER STREAMING: four messages on one stream. A second copy of the
    call was cut mid-frame, so the pane frames what it can and says the rest is short.
  - `/demo.Admin/GetStats` — HTTP 200, grpc-status **7 PERMISSION_DENIED**. The trailers carry the
    real answer; `X-Gori-Trailers` names the fields that arrived in the trailing HEADERS block.
  - `/demo.Greeter/SayHello` answered by a proxy's `text/html` **502** — still gRPC in the PROTO
    column and under `proto:grpc`, because the REQUEST said so.
  - `legacy.demo.test:8081/demo.Legacy/ListUsers` — cleartext h2c (`GRPC`), unauthenticated.
  - the grpc-web-text variant over HTTP/1.1 — the whole framed stream is base64, and its trailers
    ride INSIDE the body as a 0x80-flagged frame.
- **SSE** GET /v1/stream/prices (text/event-stream) — captured as one streamed body; the EVENTS
  pane parses it. `http://legacy.demo.test:8080/internal/events` is the cleartext one (multi-line
  `data:`, an event with no type), and `/v1/stream/orders` was dropped mid-event (ABT).
- **GraphQL** POST /graphql — plain JSON (query / mutation / introspection). Introspection is ON (see Issues).
- **SAML** POST /saml/acs — SAMLResponse is url-encoded base64 XML.
  Decode in the Decoder tab: url-decode → base64-decode (→ XML assertion for alice@demo.test).
- **Not a protocol, but the same idea** — a `connect-udp` (MASQUE) tunnel: an extended CONNECT that
  is NOT a WebSocket, so it stays HTTPS and has no transcript; a `STUB` row gori answered itself;
  a gzip'd chunked body; a plaintext forward-proxy request captured absolute-form; HTTP/1.0; a
  HEAD and a 304 with no body; and two flows that never got a response at all (ERR).

## Live target (real, replayable)
- **www.hahwul.com** is a real, live site (unlike the shop/api hosts above) — every
  captured flow is a genuine response, so Repeater (^R) actually re-sends it over the
  network and gets a live response back. Good for trying Repeater/Diff/Probe against
  real traffic instead of only synthetic data.
- Recon flow: /robots.txt -> /sitemap.xml -> / -> a css asset -> /posts/ -> an
  article -> a note -> /about/, plus one guessed path that 404s.

## Entity links
- **Issue detail** → Space → `l` opens the links overlay; `↵` opens the selected ref
  (`↑/↓`·`j/k` navigate the RELATED list). The RELATED pane lists cross-links
  (repeater/fuzz/miner/history) beyond the primary evidence flow.
- **Notes sub-tab** → Space → `l` opens links for the active note (preview strip at the bottom).
- **History / Repeater / Fuzzer / Miner** → Space → `k` link to an issue, `u` link to a note.
- This demo project already has links seeded — try the XSS or SSRF issue, or switch to the
  "Workbench cross-links" note sub-tab.
NOTES

note_links = <<-NOTES2
# Workbench cross-links

Pointers to the repeater/fuzz/miner/sequencer sessions tied to this engagement.
Space → `l` (links) on this sub-tab opens the overlay; `↵`/`o` jumps to the linked session or flow.

- **XSS PoC** repeater — re-send the reflected /search payload
- **IDOR probe** repeater — GET /v1/users/2 with the customer token (opens WITH its last response)
- **SSRF → OAST** repeater — POST /v1/import with an OAST payload host
- **bound #{bind_token("token")}** repeater — written in `#{env_token("API")}` / `#{bind_token("token")}` / `#{env_token("UA")}`, resolved at send time
- **WS chat** repeater — a WebSocket session (upgrade handshake + 4 outbound frames)
- **OAuth refresh** repeater — re-run the token exchange with a different client
- **user id enum** fuzz — sweep /v1/users/{id} (positions marked §1§)
- **login cluster bomb** fuzz — 3 usernames × 4 passwords, 401s filtered out
- **path traversal** fuzz — `§app.js¦url-encode§`, a position with a decoder chain on it
- **users path mine** — hidden-parameter probe on /v1/users/
- **header/cookie mine** — the same idea over headers + cookies
- **sid randomness** sequencer — grade the /api/login session-cookie entropy
- **oauth code entropy** sequencer — the same over a byte range of the Location header
- **WebSocket chat** flow — MESSAGES pane for the 101 upgrade
- **graphql-ws subscription** flow — a GRAPHQL pane built from the frames, not from a body
- **hahwul home** repeater — live, replayable traffic against www.hahwul.com
NOTES2

note_tools = <<-NOTES3
# Tooling cheatsheet

Which tab does what on this demo (send a selection to a tool with Space → the tool's key).

- **Rewriter** — 7 match&replace rules. Two are ON (add `X-Frame-Options`, strip the
  `Server` banner); five are staged OFF (redact `Bearer …` via regex, a body-rewrite proof,
  a forced CSP, a request-body privilege flip, and a SHORT-CIRCUIT that answers the JS
  bundle locally). Toggle one on, then re-send from Repeater to watch it take effect.
- **Rewriter → bindings** — 5 extract rules (the READ half). `token` (jsonpath) and `sid`
  (cookie) are lifted from /api/login and published as `#{bind_token("token")}` / `#{bind_token("sid")}`.
- **Env (^E)** — 5 project vars: `#{env_token("API")}`, `#{env_token("SHOP")}`, `#{env_token("AUTH")}`,
  `#{env_token("UA")}`, `#{env_token("ADMIN_ID")}`. The "bound #{bind_token("token")}" Repeater tab is
  written entirely in them; they expand only at send time.
- **Colormarker** — 7 row-colour rules (first match wins): 5xx red, 401/403 orange,
  legacy.demo.test purple, websocket blue, the token exchange green, gRPC/SSE green strip.
- **OAST** — the out-of-band listener. It holds the DNS + HTTP callbacks the server made
  when it fetched our payload host (proof of the blind SSRF). Polling is paused on load.
- **Sequencer** — "sid randomness" re-collects the login cookie and grades its entropy;
  "oauth code entropy" does the same over a byte range of a Location header.
- **JWT** — two real HS256 tokens to try: the session token and the OIDC `id_token` from
  /oauth/token. Decode the claims, run the weak-secret attack (it recovers the key),
  then re-forge `{"role":"admin"}` or try alg:none.
- **Decoder** — opens with 5 sub-tabs already loaded: the SAML assertion (url → base64),
  the session JWT, the Flask cookie (`cookie-decode` auto-detects the framework), the
  Basic-auth credentials, and a hash of the DSN leaked by the bundle.
- **Cookie workbench** — three signed cookies on legacy.demo.test: Flask (/admin/dashboard),
  Django (/py/portal), Rack (/rb/orders). Crack them with
  `gori run cookie --crack --secrets #{COOKIE_SECRET},dev,changeme <cookie>`; the Flask and
  Django keys are the same, Rack's is longer.
- **Comparer** — diff two flows side by side (e.g. /v1/users/1 vs /v1/users/2 for the IDOR,
  or the two /v1/products pages).
- **Probe** — passive findings over every seeded flow, plus 4 project custom rules and 4
  seeded ACTIVE findings (reflected param, open redirect, CORS, blind SSRF) with their
  out-of-band probe records. Mode is Passive; live active probing needs live traffic.
- **Target** — Sitemap (10 tagged paths across 6 hosts) + Discover.
- **Settings → network** — 5 hostname overrides point the fictional .test hosts at loopback.
NOTES3

note_start = <<-NOTES4
# Start here — a 10-minute tour

1. **History** — rows are coloured by the Colormarker rules (5xx red, 401/403 orange,
   legacy purple). Sort by duration to find the 8.4s export; `/v1/reports/rebuild` reads
   ERR — a request whose response never arrived, adopted as orphaned on the next open.
   Look at the PROTO column: HTTP/HTTPS, WS/WSS, GRPC/GRPCS, SSE/SSES and one STUB row are
   all present. `proto:grpc` finds the cleartext AND the TLS gRPC calls; `proto:grpcs` only
   the TLS ones. See the "Protocols on this target" section of the recon note for the tour.
   Then look at the SRC column beside it: five rows say something other than `PROXY`, and
   they are the ones the target's own client never sent. `src:gori` selects them (a yellow
   strip marks them too); `src:proxy` reads History as traffic that really happened. See
   "Where these flows came from" in the recon note.
2. **A binary body** — open `GET /avatars/1.png` (cdn.demo.test): no text rendering, so
   the pane falls back to hex. `GET /ko/notice` is EUC-KR — bytes that are not UTF-8.
3. **The Decoder** already has five sub-tabs loaded. Run the SAML one, then the Flask
   cookie one (`cookie-decode` auto-detects Flask vs Rack vs Django).
4. **JWT** — send the login token (Space → JWT), crack the secret, re-forge the payload.
5. **Repeater** — "bound #{bind_token("token")}" is written in `#{env_token("API")}` /
   `#{bind_token("token")}`. Open the env overlay (^E)
   to see where those come from, then look at the "WS chat" tab: a WebSocket session with
   four outbound frames queued.
6. **Issues** — 18 of them, deliberately across all four triage states. The two on
   legacy.demo.test are cookie findings; the .env one is Critical. Two more come from the
   protocol traffic: a session JWT on a cleartext WebSocket, and an unauthenticated gRPC
   admin service on h2c.
7. **Probe** — passive findings from the traffic plus four active ones. The list defaults
   to OPEN findings; press `a` to include the triaged ones — two are confirmed (the blind
   SSRF and the CORS reflection) and one header rule is muted project-wide. Follow the
   SSRF to the OAST tab, which holds the DNS + HTTP callbacks that proved it.
8. **www.hahwul.com** — the only REAL host here. Its Repeater tab ("hahwul home") genuinely
   re-sends over the network, so Repeater → Comparer against a live response works.
