# Verifies that packaging/nix/shards.nix still describes the dependency set shard.lock
# pins.
#
# `just nix-shards` regenerates that file with crystal2nix, and AGENTS.md asks for
# it in the same commit as the dependency change — but nothing enforced it, and the
# failure is silent in the worst way: bump a shard, forget the regeneration, and
# `nix build` stays green while linking the OLD revisions. The flake produces a
# binary this tree does not describe, and no output anywhere says so.
#
# This reads the two files and compares them, so it needs neither Nix nor the
# network — which is the point. CI has no Nix job (the flake pins its own compiler,
# several minutes cold), so the check that would catch this by building does not run.
#
# Usage: crystal run scripts/nix_shards_check.cr  (just nix-shards-check)
