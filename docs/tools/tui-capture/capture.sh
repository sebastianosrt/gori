# capture.sh — regenerate the TUI screenshots under docs/static/images/tui/.
#
# It drives a real gori TUI inside an isolated tmux session against a throwaway
# project seeded with real traffic, grabs each screen as truecolor ANSI
# (tmux capture-pane -e), and renders every frame to a self-contained SVG with
# ansi2svg.py. Nothing here touches your real ~/.gori.
#
# Every scene is shot once per theme so the docs can swap the whole gallery when
# the reader flips light/dark. By default the dark set lands in tui/ and the
# light set in tui/light/; the docs pick the right one from the active theme.
#
# Requirements: bash, tmux, python3, curl, sqlite3, and a built ./bin/gori.
# Usage:  docs/tools/tui-capture/capture.sh [path-to-gori-binary]
# Env:    SHOTS="theme:subdir …"   which palettes to shoot and where under tui/.
#           default: "goridark: goriday:light"  (dark → tui/, light → tui/light/)
#           e.g. SHOTS="goriday:light" to refresh only the light set.
#         ONLY="scenes themes readme"  which groups to shoot (default: all three).
#           e.g. ONLY=readme to refresh just the README hero shot.
#
# The captures are deliberately reproducible but not pixel-identical run to run
# (timestamps, durations, and live response bodies vary). Eyeball the output.
