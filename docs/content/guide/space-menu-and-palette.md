gori has hundreds of actions, and you do not need to learn their keys up front. Two keys reach all of them:

| Press | You get | Reach for it when |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| `Space` | The **space menu**: what you do most in the pane you are in, one letter per action | You know roughly what you want to do *here* |
| `Ctrl-P` | The **command palette**: every action, found by typing its name | You don't know where something lives, or you rarely need it |

Both show each action's own key beside it, so every visit teaches you the shortcut, and you need them less the more you use them. `?` opens the **Help** tab, the full key sheet.

> **Learn it hands-on.** `gori tutorial` (or `Ctrl-P` → **Guided tour** from inside a session) has a lesson on each, on a mock UI where nothing you press is real.

## The space menu {#space-menu}

Press `Space` in any list or pane. A card opens with the actions for **where you are standing**: a History row, a flow's detail, the Repeater editor, a rule list. The same key on a different pane gives a different card.

<figure class="tui-shot">
  <img src="/images/tui/space-menu.svg" alt="gori space menu open over the History tab, its rows grouped under VIEW, SEND, TRIAGE, COPY, SCOPE, COMMON, DANGER and WIPE, each with a letter on the left and, for some, a shortcut on the right">
  <figcaption><kbd>Space</kbd> on a History row. The letter on the left runs the row; the key on the right is the shortcut that does the same without the menu; <code>›</code> opens a second card.</figcaption>
</figure>

How to read the card:

- **The letter on the left runs the row.** Press `y` and the flow is copied; the menu closes.
- **The key on the right is the row's shortcut.** `r Repeater flow ^R` means `Ctrl-R` sends to the Repeater from the list, with no menu at all. A row without one is reached through the menu (or the palette).
- **A `›` row opens a second card** instead of running. See [Second cards](#cards).
- **Rows are grouped by purpose**: VIEW, SEND, TRIAGE, COPY, and so on. Delete sits under DANGER and a whole-tab wipe under WIPE, always last, and a wipe asks before it acts.

### Moving inside the menu {#menu-keys}

| Key | Does |
|-----|------|
| a row's letter | run that row |
| `↑` / `↓` or `j` / `k` | move the selection |
| `←` / `→` or `h` / `l` | change column |
| `↵` | run the selected row |
| `Esc` | close the menu, or go back one level from a second card |

`h`, `j`, `k` and `l` are never a row's letter, so they always move and a reflex `j` never runs anything. Any key the card does not list closes it.

## Second cards {#cards}

Some choices are variations of one intent: *send this flow to some tool*, *change how this pane draws*. Each of those is a single `›` row on the menu that opens its own card, so the first card stays short.

<figure class="tui-shot">
  <img src="/images/tui/space-menu-send.svg" alt="gori's Send flow to card, titled SPACE › SEND FLOW TO, listing Repeater, Fuzzer, Comparer, Miner, Sequencer, Authorize, Discover and browser, each on one letter">
  <figcaption><kbd>Space</kbd> <kbd>&gt;</kbd> on a History row. The title shows where you are, and <kbd>Esc</kbd> steps back to the first card.</figcaption>
</figure>

| Row | Holds | Found on |
|-----|-------|----------|
| `>` **Send flow to…** | Hand the selected flow to another tool: `r` Repeater, `f` Fuzzer, `c` Comparer, `m` Miner, `s` Sequencer, `a` Authorize, `D` Discover, `b` open the response in a browser | tabs where a flow is selected: History, the flow detail, the Sitemap, the Repeater, Fuzzer results, … |
| `Z` **Display…** | Toggles for how the pane draws: hex, pretty, diff, follow, columns, folds, … | lists and request/response panes |
| `P` **Protocol…** | What a request sends: HTTP/2, SNI, auto Content-Length, gRPC, TLS fingerprint | Repeater, Fuzzer |
| `T` **Sub-tabs…** | New, close, duplicate, rename, mark and find sub-tabs | a pane on the nine tabs with a sub-tab strip (Repeater, Fuzzer, Notes, …) |

Three things make them quick:

- **Same letters on every tab.** Inside a card, a tool or a toggle keeps its letter wherever the card appears: `Space` `>` `c` sends to the Comparer from History, the Sitemap or a Repeater tab alike.
- **`>`, `⇧Z` and `⇧P` open their card directly**, without `Space`: `>` `f` sends the selected flow to the Fuzzer.
- **Display… and Protocol… stay open.** After you flip a toggle the card comes back at the same row, so you can flip two or three in one visit, and each row shows its state: `●` on, `○` off, or a value such as the TLS preset's name. `Esc` closes it.

On a tab with a sub-tab strip, focus the strip itself (or the tab bar) and `Space` lists the sub-tab actions directly, with no `T` in front. `Ctrl-N` and `Ctrl-W` (new and close sub-tab) work from any pane.

## Letters you can guess {#letters}

An action that appears on many tabs has **the same letter on all of them**, so a letter you learn on one tab works on the next. The ones worth knowing first:

| Letter | Action |
|--------|--------|
| `/` | filter this list |
| `y` · `Y` | copy · copy as… |
| `t` · `T` | mark · mark all |
| `a` · `e` | add (on most tabs, file an issue) · edit |
| `d` | delete the selected row |
| `r` | send to the Repeater, or run (the menu twin of `Ctrl-R`) |
| `E` | export |
| `L` | link to an issue or a note |
| `X` | wipe the tab (asks first) |

The whole table, with the reasoning behind it, is in [Hotkeys → One intent, one letter](/guide/hotkeys/#one-intent-one-letter).

A missed `Space` is unlikely to surprise you. gori checks at startup that a menu letter does not mean a different action as a bare key in the same pane, apart from a few documented cases, and it keeps `c` (capture) and `i` (intercept) off the menu on every tab that does not use those letters itself.

## The command palette {#palette}

Press `Ctrl-P` on any tab and start typing the name of what you want.

<figure class="tui-shot">
  <img src="/images/tui/command-palette.svg" alt="gori command palette over the History tab with the query send: THIS TAB lists Send to Comparer, Send to Fuzzer, Send to Sequencer and Send to Authorize with their keys or menu paths on the right, then APP lists matching app commands">
  <figcaption><kbd>Ctrl-P</kbd>, then <code>send</code>, on History. The tab's own actions come first, each with the key or menu path that reaches it; app-wide commands follow.</figcaption>
</figure>

- **With nothing typed**, the palette lists the app-wide commands: settings, **Open browser**, **Go to** a tab, **Guided tour**, and the like.
- **Once you type**, it also searches the actions of the pane you opened it from. Those come first under `THIS TAB`, and app-wide matches follow under `APP`.
- **The right-hand column tells you the short route for next time.** `shift-i` is a key; `␣ > c` is a menu path: `Space`, then `>`, then `c`.
- `↑` / `↓` select, `↵` runs, `Esc` closes. Opened over a flow's detail, it searches the detail's actions, and `Esc` returns you to it.
- If you have rows marked, the title reads `COMMANDS · 3 MARKED`: an action you pick will apply to all of them.

### Actions only the palette lists {#palette-only}

To keep the space menu short, a few kinds of action have no row in it. Some repeat a key you already have, such as Mark word (`Ctrl-K`); others are set once a session, such as **Minimize request** or **Go to line**. Type the name into `Ctrl-P` from the tab it belongs to and it appears under `THIS TAB`. Help names the route for each one: its key, or `^P → <name>`.

The full list is in [Hotkeys → Actions only the palette lists](/guide/hotkeys/#palette-only).

## Try it: five minutes {#try-it}

You need a project with a few captured flows. The [Quick Start](/getting-started/quick-start/) gets you there.

1. Press `3` for **History** and `↓` to select a flow. Press `Space` and read the card: find the `›` rows, and the `^R` beside **Repeater flow**. Press `Esc`.

   **Checkpoint.** You can say, without opening the menu, which key sends the selected flow to the Repeater.

2. Press `Space`, then `>`. The card title reads `SPACE › SEND FLOW TO`. Press `Esc` once, and you are back on the first card; press it again, and the menu closes.

3. Press `Space`, then `Z`. The **Display…** card shows `●` or `○` beside each toggle. Press `f` to flip **follow**: the card stays open and the dot changes. Press `f` again to put it back, then `Esc`.

   **Checkpoint.** You have used a second card, stepped back out of one, and flipped a toggle without the card closing.

4. Press `Ctrl-P` and type `send`. Under `THIS TAB`, find a row whose right-hand column is a key and one whose column is a menu path. Press `Esc`.

5. Press `Ctrl-P`, type `tour`, and press `↵` to run the guided tour, or `Esc` if you have already taken it.

   **Checkpoint.** You can find an action by name, and read off the shorter way to reach it.

## When a key does nothing {#troubleshooting}

- **`Space` typed a space.** You are editing text (the pane's badge reads `INS`). Press `Esc` to go back to `READ`, then `Space`.
- **A letter from a guide does nothing.** Menu letters belong to the pane you are in. Open the menu to see what this pane offers, or search the action's name with `Ctrl-P`: it may be one of the [palette-only actions](#palette-only).
- **You rebound a shortcut.** A rebind changes the key on the right of a row, never the row's letter. The menu and the palette both show your new key.
- **You picked the vim keyset.** The keyset changes how you move and select in editors; it leaves every menu letter where it was. See [Editor keysets](/guide/hotkeys/#editor-keysets).
