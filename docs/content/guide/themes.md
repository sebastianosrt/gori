gori ships thirty-two built-in colour themes: `goridark` (the default), `goriday`, `dancheong`, `hanji`, `latte`, `espresso`, `tokyonight`, `gruvbox`, `nord`, `dracula`, `solarized_light`, `rosepine_dawn`, `catppuccin_mocha`, `monokai`, `everforest`, `onedark`, `kanagawa`, `github_dark`, `zenburn`, `synthwave84`, `cyberpunk`, `matrix`, `cobalt2`, `high_contrast`, `github_light`, `gruvbox_light`, `one_light`, `ayu_light`, `rosepine`, `tokyonight_day`, `solarized_dark`, and `everforest_light`.

## Switching Themes

Open Preferences with `Ctrl-,` (or the `⚙` chip in the top bar), go to **Appearance**, and press `↵` on the **Theme** row. The row previews the current theme inline: its name and a small swatch of its palette. `Ctrl-P` → **Settings: Theme** opens the same picker in one step.

The picker is a vertical, scrollable list; each row shows a small swatch of the theme's own palette, and selecting a row previews it live. `Enter` applies and persists the choice, `Esc` reverts.

`Ctrl-,` works in the project picker too, so you can set your theme on first launch before opening a project. Every form section is editable there, and Theme is the one opener that works; the other openers (Tabs, Env, Hotkeys, hostname overrides, and User-Agents) need a project open.

The same History view across six of the built-ins:

## Custom Themes

You can add your own themes as JSON files, dropped into:

```
~/.gori/themes/<name>.json
```

(`~/.gori` is the gori home directory; override it with `$GORI_HOME`.) The file name is the theme name. `ocean.json` becomes the theme `ocean`. Custom themes appear in the picker after the built-ins, in file-name order. gori loads them at startup and again each time you open the theme picker, so you can drop a file in and reopen it without restarting.

### Format

A theme is a JSON object mapping palette fields to `#rrggbb` hex colours. Use the optional `"base"` key to inherit every colour you don't override from a built-in theme, so a theme can be as small as one accent tweak:

```json
{
  "base": "goridark",
  "accent": "#ff33cc",
  "syn_header": "#33ccff"
}
```

Without `"base"`, the default (`goridark`) supplies any omitted colour.

### A Full Theme

Every field, all inheriting from `base` when omitted:

```json
{
  "base": "goridark",

  "bg":            "#0a0a0b",
  "panel":         "#141417",
  "elevated":      "#1b1b1f",
  "border":        "#2a2a30",
  "border_focus":  "#3a3a42",
  "focus_gold":    "#d9c28b",
  "accent":        "#fafafa",
  "accent_bg":     "#26262c",
  "selection_dim": "#19191c",
  "text":          "#c8c8cc",
  "text_bright":   "#fafafa",
  "muted":         "#6e6e76",
  "green":         "#52c77a",
  "yellow":        "#d6a13a",
  "red":           "#e5534b",
  "orange":        "#d9813f",
  "syn_header":    "#82a8c4",
  "syn_string":    "#8fb87a",
  "syn_number":    "#ca9b6a",
  "syn_literal":   "#b08ec2",
  "syn_comment":   "#6f8172",
  "syn_keyword":   "#d08c9a"
}
```

| Field | Used For |
|-------|----------|
| `bg` | The canvas (main background) |
| `panel` | Top bar, status bar, overlays |
| `elevated` | Header bands, active segments |
| `border` | Resting hairline dividers |
| `border_focus` | The outline of an active modal card |
| `focus_gold` | The focused body pane's outline |
| `accent` | The highlight colour (selection marker, emphasis) |
| `accent_bg` | The selection band in the focused pane |
| `selection_dim` | The selection band in an unfocused pane |
| `text` | Body text |
| `text_bright` | Emphasised / active text |
| `muted` | Secondary / dimmed text |
| `green` | 2xx status |
| `yellow` | 4xx status |
| `red` | 5xx status / errors |
| `orange` | Accent for warnings |
| `syn_header` | Header/field names, JSON keys, tag names |
| `syn_string` | Quoted strings |
| `syn_number` | Numbers, tag attribute names |
| `syn_literal` | `true` / `false` / `null` |
| `syn_comment` | Comments (GraphQL `#`, JSONC `//`, HTML `<!-- -->`) |
| `syn_keyword` | Language keywords, auth schemes |

### Notes

- `"base"` must name a built-in theme. A custom theme can't be the base of another, and an unknown base falls back to `goridark`.
- The file name is normalised to lower-case `a-z 0-9 - _`; other characters are dropped (`My Theme!.json` → `mytheme`).
- A file whose name collides with a built-in (e.g. `goridark.json`) is ignored. The built-ins can't be redefined.
- Loading is tolerant: an unreadable file, invalid JSON, or a non-object is skipped, and a single malformed colour falls back to the `base` value rather than discarding the whole theme. A broken theme file never crashes the TUI.
- For readability, keep your functional colours (text, status, syntax) well-contrasted against `bg`; the built-ins target WCAG AA (≥ 4.5:1).

## Next Steps

- [Hotkeys](/guide/hotkeys/): rebind gori's keyboard shortcuts the same way
- [Settings](/guide/settings/): the Preferences modal and every section in it
- [Configuration](/getting-started/configuration/): where `settings.json` lives and what else it holds
