Some bugs never show up in the response. A blind SSRF, a blind XXE, an out-of-band SQL injection, or a stored payload that only fires in a back-office browser all reach out to *some other server* instead of answering you. **OAST** (Out-of-band Application Security Testing) gives you that server: gori registers a payload URL with an interaction listener, you plant the payload in a request, and any DNS, HTTP, or SMTP callback the target makes to it shows up as a hit.

The **OAST** tab is visible by default (next to Fuzzer). It has two sub-tabs: **Callbacks** (the hits, default) and **Providers** (the listeners you've configured).

## The Loop

1. On the **OAST** tab, press `Ctrl-R` to start listening. gori registers with a provider and mints a **payload** (a unique hostname/URL).
2. Copy the payload with `g` (get payload) or `y`, or insert it straight into a request from **Repeater** / **Fuzzer** (`Space` → **Insert OAST payload** drops it at the cursor). From **History**, `Space` → **Copy OAST payload**.
3. Plant it wherever the target might dereference a URL or resolve a hostname: a URL parameter, a `Host`/`X-Forwarded-For` header, an XML entity, a webhook field.
4. When the target's infrastructure resolves the name or connects back, the callback lands in **Callbacks** with its protocol (`dns` / `http` / `smtp`), source IP, timestamp, and the full sub-identifier so you can tell which payload fired.

A callback is proof the target reached a server it shouldn't have. The absence of one is not proof of safety (egress may be filtered), only that this path stayed quiet.

## Providers

Each listener is a **provider**. Add one from the **Providers** sub-tab (`a` add, `e` edit, `t` set type, `d` delete); a public preset auto-fills the server host when you pick its type.

The bar above the callbacks table selects which provider `g` and `Ctrl-R` act on; `←` / `→` cycle it (the bar draws the pick as `‹ name ›`), and **All** shows every provider's callbacks at once. Getting a payload or starting a listener needs one provider, so on **All** with two or more providers enabled, `g` and `Ctrl-R` open a picker card; pick a row with `↵` and the bar follows. With a single enabled provider there is nothing to ask, and the action just runs.

| Provider | What it is |
|----------|-----------|
| `interactsh` | Self-hosted or public [interactsh](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/interactsh) servers. Catches encrypted **DNS, HTTP, and SMTP** callbacks. Public presets: `oast.pro`, `oast.live`, `oast.site`, `oast.fun`, `oast.me`. Default. |
| `custom-http` | A plain HTTP endpoint you control and poll for hits. |
| `webhook.site` | The public [webhook.site](https://webhook.site) service (HTTP only). |
| `BOAST` | A [BOAST](https://github.com/firebasextended/boast) server (public preset `odiss.eu`). |
| `postbin` | A PostBin instance (`postb.in`). |

With interactsh, gori generates an RSA key pair locally, registers the public key, and decrypts each callback (the private key is stored `0600` in the project database and never logged). The payload id is derived locally from the correlation id, so you can mint many payloads from one registration without another round trip.

## Resuming a Listener

The callbacks that matter most arrive late: a stored payload that only fires when someone opens a back-office page, a webhook a nightly job replays, an injection behind a queue. So a listener outlives the session that started it.

`Ctrl-X` stops polling but **keeps the registration**, and so does quitting gori or leaving the project. The payloads you already planted keep resolving. Press `r` to open **RESUME LISTENER**, pick a saved session, and gori starts polling it again. Every callback the provider buffered while you were away lands on the next poll, and the session's existing callbacks are still there under it.

| Key | In the picker |
|-----|---------------|
| `↵` | Resume polling this session |
| `x` | Release it: deregister the server-side state for a finished engagement. Its callbacks stay. |

Callbacks are durable per-project history. Resume is a deliberate action, not something gori does on startup: reopening a project does not put you back on a third-party provider without asking.

All three surfaces resume the same sessions. `gori run oast list` / `resume` / `release` and the MCP `list_oast_sessions` / `oast_resume` / `oast_release` act on the rows this picker shows, and a resumed headless listener writes its callbacks into the project, so the tab, a script, and an agent are reading one table. What stays ad-hoc is `gori run oast listen` and MCP `oast_start`: they register with no project behind them, and those registrations end with the process.

No surface resumes on its own. Opening a project, binding an MCP server, or starting a `gori run` never re-arms a listener; someone asks for it.

## Keys

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Ctrl-R` | Start listening (register a payload and begin polling) |
| `Ctrl-X` | Stop polling (the session is kept; resume it with `r`) |
| `r` | Resume a saved listener |
| `g` | Get / copy the current payload (asks which provider on **All**) |
| `←` / `→` | Cycle the provider the bar acts on |
| `y` | Copy the selected callback |
| `Shift-F` | File the selected callback as an Issue |
| `/` | Filter the callback list |
| `a` / `e` / `t` / `d` | Providers sub-tab: add / edit / set type / delete |

## Filing a Callback

A callback is the strongest evidence this tool produces: the target's own infrastructure reached a server it was never given a reason to reach. `Shift-F` (or `Space` → **Add issue**) files the selected callback as an **Issue**, prefilled with its protocol and source and carrying the raw interaction in as the notes. It opens at **HIGH**; Tab re-rates it before you commit.

## Headless

`gori run oast listen` is an ad-hoc, store-free listener: it registers a payload, prints it to stdout, then streams callbacks until you stop it.

```bash
gori run oast presets                          # list the built-in public providers
gori run oast listen                           # interactsh, poll until Ctrl-C
gori run oast listen --provider webhook.site   # a different provider
gori run oast listen --once --json             # poll once, emit JSON lines
```

The project's saved sessions (the ones the picker above resumes) are reachable headlessly too:

```bash
gori run oast list                             # id, provider, payload host, hits, last poll
gori run oast resume 7                         # re-arm session #7 and stream its callbacks
gori run oast resume 7 --once --json           # one poll, JSON lines, then exit
gori run oast release 7                        # deregister it; its callbacks stay
```

`resume` keeps the registration on exit (Ctrl-C stops polling, nothing more) and persists every callback it catches into the project, so the OAST tab shows the same hits. `release` is the deliberate teardown.

See the [CLI Reference](/reference/cli/#run-oast) for every flag. Over MCP, an agent drives the same engine with `oast_presets` / `oast_payload` / `oast_poll` / `list_oast_sessions` (read) and `oast_start` / `oast_stop` / `oast_resume` / `oast_release` (action). `oast_resume` returns a `session_id` that `oast_poll` and `oast_payload` take, and its polls are persisted like the CLI's; `oast_stop` on a resumed session stops polling but keeps it resumable, exactly as `Ctrl-X` does.

> A callback means the target contacted a third-party interaction server, and public interactsh/webhook servers see that callback's metadata. Only run OAST against systems you are authorized to test, and prefer a self-hosted server for sensitive engagements.

## Next Steps

- [Repeater & Fuzzer](/guide/repeater-and-fuzzer/): plant payloads and fuzz them across positions
- [Scanning & Issues](/guide/scanning/): promote a confirmed callback into an Issue
- [MCP Server](/guide/mcp/): let an agent register a payload and poll for hits
