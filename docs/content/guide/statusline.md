The **statusline** is an opt-in row at the very bottom of the TUI. gori runs a shell command on an interval and renders its stdout as that row — a status bar you write yourself, inspired by Claude Code's status line. It ships off, and the `statusline` section stays out of `settings.json` until you change something.

## Turning it on

Open Preferences with `Ctrl-,`, go to **General**, and the **Statusline** rows are there: the **Statusline** toggle (off by default), the `Command` field, and the `Interval` and `Timeout` seconds. Turn the toggle on and give it a command, and the row appears under the status bar.

The same thing in `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "statusline": {
    "enabled": true,
    "command": "date '+%H:%M'",
    "interval": 3,
    "timeout": 10
  }
}
```

That is a clock: the shape is the point, and what belongs in `command` instead is the rest of this page.

Every key, its default and its exact meaning: [`statusline` in the configuration reference](/reference/config/#statusline).

Three things worth knowing before you write one:

- **Only the first line of stdout is used**, truncated to the terminal width. A script that prints a paragraph draws its first line and nothing else.
- **ANSI/SGR colour escapes are honoured** — 16-colour, 256-colour and truecolor, plus bold, underline and friends — so the row can be coloured segments rather than one flat string.
- **Edits take effect immediately.** Saving a new `command`, `interval` or `timeout` re-runs the command on the next frame instead of waiting out the current interval.

It never blocks the UI: runs happen off the draw path, and they never overlap — gori launches the next one only after the previous has finished.

## Presets {#presets}

The top bar already carries what gori knows about itself: the project, capture state, the
address it is bound to, the scan mode. A statusline earns its row by saying what the bar
cannot — something from outside gori, or something gori holds but does not count for you.

Each of these is one line and goes straight into `command`, because the settings form's
field is one line too. `\u001b` is how `jq` spells the escape character; the colours are
optional. Under each command is the row it actually produced.

{% preset(title="How long the token you are testing with has left", src="/images/tui/statusline-token.svg", alt="A statusline row: a green dot, then the words token 58m left", note="Keep the bearer token under test in a file and the row counts it down, turning red under five minutes — before a sweep starts coming back 401 and you spend ten minutes debugging the wrong thing. Any JWT tool would do here; gori has one.") %}
```sh
jq -rn --argjson exp "$(gori run jwt "$(cat "${GORI_HOME:-$HOME/.gori}/token.jwt")" --format json | jq .payload.exp)" '(($exp - now) / 60 | floor) as $m | if $m < 5 then "\u001b[31m⚠ token \($m)m left\u001b[0m" else "\u001b[32m●\u001b[0m token \($m)m left" end'
```
{% end %}

{% preset(title="Whether the target has started answering 5xx", src="/images/tui/statusline-errors.svg", alt="A statusline row in red: 1 × 5xx", note="A History query on a timer. It asks the whole project, not the rows History happens to be filtered to, and it prints nothing while the target is healthy — so the row appears the moment you break something.") %}
```sh
p=$(jq -r .project); gori run history --project "$p" -q 'status:>=500' -n 100000 --format json 2>/dev/null | jq -r 'length | if . == 0 then "" else "\u001b[31m\(.) × 5xx\u001b[0m" end'
```
{% end %}

{% preset(title="What is still unchecked in your notes", src="/images/tui/statusline-todo.svg", alt="A statusline row: todo 2, then the text of the first unchecked task in the project notes", note="The `- [ ]` items in the project's notes, counted, with the first one spelled out. Your checklist stays in front of you instead of in a tab you have to go and open.") %}
```sh
p=$(jq -r .project); gori run notes --all --project "$p" | awk '/^- \[ \]/ { n++; if (n == 1) first = substr($0, 7) } END { if (n) printf "todo %d · %s", n, first }'
```
{% end %}

Everything in [the context](#context) is fair game too — `\(.flows)`, `\(.issues)`, the
mode flags — but read the top bar first: a segment that repeats a chip costs you a row and
tells you nothing. The shape that pays is the one above, gori's own data crossed with
something gori has no way to know:

```sh
# The project, and the branch you are testing it from.
printf '%s · %s' "$(jq -r .project)" "$(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null)"
```

## When one line is not enough {#script}

Past a segment or two, `command` stops being a field you type into and becomes a script you
keep. Point it at one:

```json
{
  "statusline": {
    "enabled": true,
    "command": "sh \"${GORI_HOME:-$HOME/.gori}/statusline.sh\"",
    "interval": 5
  }
}
```

```sh
#!/bin/sh
# statusline.sh — one row: how long the token has, whether the target is erroring,
# and what is still unchecked. The context arrives on stdin, so read it once.
ctx=$(cat)
project=$(printf '%s' "$ctx" | jq -r .project)

token=$(jq -rn --argjson exp "$(gori run jwt "$(cat "${GORI_HOME:-$HOME/.gori}/token.jwt")" --format json | jq .payload.exp)" \
  '(($exp - now) / 60 | floor) as $m | if $m < 5 then "\u001b[31m⚠ token \($m)m left\u001b[0m" else "\u001b[32m●\u001b[0m token \($m)m left" end')
errors=$(gori run history --project "$project" -q 'status:>=500' -n 100000 --format json 2>/dev/null |
  jq -r 'length | if . == 0 then "" else "\u001b[31m\(.) × 5xx\u001b[0m" end')
todo=$(gori run notes --all --project "$project" |
  awk '/^- \[ \]/ { n++; if (n == 1) first = substr($0, 7) } END { if (n) printf "todo %d · %s", n, first }')

printf '%s' "$token"
[ -n "$errors" ] && printf '   %s' "$errors"
[ -n "$todo" ] && printf '   %s' "$todo"
printf '\n'
```

That is the row in the shot at the top of this page: the three presets above, joined, with
each part printed only when it has something to say. Two things make it work — the context is
read **once** into `$ctx`, because stdin is a pipe (see [above](#context)), and the last
statement is a plain `printf`, so a quiet run still exits 0 rather than reporting `⋯ (exit 1)`.

Give it `interval: 5` or more: the script spawns three short-lived processes per run, which is
nothing next to a browser but is not worth doing every second.

## The context on stdin {#context}

Each run receives a JSON context on stdin describing the live session, so scripts can display proxy state without querying gori:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "project": "acme",
  "capturing": true,
  "flows": 1234,
  "proxy": { "host": "127.0.0.1", "port": 8070, "addr": "127.0.0.1:8070" },
  "upstream": "",
  "upstream_rules": 0,
  "upstream_env": "",
  "scope": { "active": true, "rules": 2, "sandbox": false },
  "intercept": { "enabled": false, "queued": 0, "direction": "requestonly" },
  "probe": "passive",
  "issues": 7,
  "jobs": { "running": 1, "label": "fuzzing 1" }
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `version` | integer | Context schema version (currently `1`) |
| `project` | string | Active project name |
| `capturing` | bool | Whether the proxy is currently capturing |
| `flows` | integer | Number of captured flows |
| `proxy.host` / `proxy.port` / `proxy.addr` | string / integer / string | The address the proxy is actually listening on |
| `upstream` | string | The **catch-all** upstream proxy address/URI, or empty when connecting directly. A destination matched by an [upstream rule](/reference/config/#upstream-rules) routes elsewhere; this field does not reflect that |
| `upstream_rules` | integer | Number of [upstream rules](/reference/config/#upstream-rules) in effect. Non-zero means routing is per-destination and `upstream` alone does not describe where traffic goes |
| `upstream_env` | string | The process proxy variable routing traffic when `upstream` is empty and no rule claims the host, e.g. `HTTPS_PROXY → http proxy corp.example:3128`, qualified with `· destinations no upstream rule claims` once a rule table narrows it (`the project destination filter admits` when the project's **Destination host** narrows it, both joined with `and`); empty when nothing can reach the environment (a project pin, a non-empty `upstream`, or a `*` rule). Never carries credentials |
| `scope.active` / `scope.rules` | bool / integer | Whether [scope](/guide/proxy/#scope) filtering is actually in force — the lens is on **and** at least one rule exists — and how many rules there are |
| `scope.sandbox` | bool | Whether the [Sandbox](/guide/proxy/#sandbox) is blocking out-of-scope destinations outright, rather than merely not recording them |
| `intercept.enabled` | bool | Whether catch is on. Real clients are held while it is |
| `intercept.queued` | integer | Messages waiting for a decision right now |
| `intercept.direction` | string | `requestonly` (the default), `responseonly` or `both` — which leg is caught |
| `probe` | string | The [scanner](/guide/scanning/#probe-the-scanner) mode: `off`, `passive`, `active` or `aggressive` |
| `issues` | integer | Issues recorded in this project |
| `jobs.running` | integer | Background jobs in flight (fuzz, mine, discover, …) — the same book the activity chip counts, so an in-flight Repeater send is not one |
| `jobs.label` | string \| null | What the status bar's activity chip says, e.g. `"fuzzing 1"`; `null` when nothing is running |

Everything from `scope` down describes what gori is *set to do next* rather than what it has already captured — the same facts the top bar's chips carry, so a statusline can answer "is intercept still on?" without you looking up. The fields are additive and `version` stays `1`: a script written against an earlier context reads identically.

**stdin is read once.** It is a pipe, not a file, so the first command that consumes it gets everything and the second gets nothing — `"$(jq -r .project)" "$(jq -r .flows)"` silently prints an empty flow count. Read the whole context with one `jq`, as the presets above do, or capture it first:

```sh
ctx=$(cat); printf '%s · %s flows' "$(echo "$ctx" | jq -r .project)" "$(echo "$ctx" | jq -r .flows)"
```

## When the command fails {#failures}

A command that fails without printing anything reports its exit status instead of leaving the row blank: `⋯ (exit 127)` for a command that was not found, `⋯ (killed)` for one a signal ended. A run that overruns `timeout` is terminated and the row reads `⋯ (timed out)`, and a command gori could not start at all reads `⋯ (statusline failed)` (or `⋯ (statusline error)` for an internal fault). A command that exits cleanly having printed nothing leaves the row empty, which is a legitimate thing for a script to do. stderr is discarded either way.

Every one of these markers is drawn in the caution colour rather than in body text, so a statusline that has stopped working never reads as one reporting bad news.

`timeout` is deliberately separate from `interval`. Because runs never overlap, a script slower than `interval` simply refreshes as fast as it can rather than being killed on every run; only `timeout` ends one.

A command that backgrounds work (`curl … &`) must clean up after itself: gori kills the `/bin/sh` it started, and cannot reach anything that shell forked — it shares gori's own process group, so signalling the group would take gori down with it. A timed-out run is sent `SIGTERM` before `SIGKILL`, so a `trap … TERM` around `cmd & wait` gets to tidy up; the simpler answer is to bound the command itself (`curl --max-time 2`, `timeout 2 …`).

## Where else a command can run

The statusline is one of five settings that carry a command rather than data. The others are [process hooks](/guide/scripting/#process-hooks) and the external editor; a profile exported with `gori settings export` can carry all of them, and both ends of that transfer [say so](/reference/cli/#profiles-that-carry-commands).
