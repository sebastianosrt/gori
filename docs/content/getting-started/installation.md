gori is written in [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/). Pick a pre-built channel below, or [build from source](#build-from-source) if none fits your platform. Every channel installs the same `gori` binary. Once it's on your `PATH`, jump to [Verify the Installation](#verify-the-installation).

## Quick install (curl)

macOS and Linux one-liner. Detects OS/arch, downloads the matching [GitHub Release](https://github.com/hahwul/gori/releases/latest) asset, and puts `gori` on your `PATH`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://gori.hahwul.com/install.sh | bash
```

Installs under `/usr/local` when writable, otherwise `~/.local`. Override with `GORI_INSTALL_PREFIX`. After install, `gori update` self-updates the binary (or guides you through Chocolatey / Homebrew / Snap / AUR when those channels own the install).

### If you hit a GitHub rate limit

The installer asks the GitHub API which release is latest, and that API allows only **60 unauthenticated requests per hour per IP**, so behind shared CI or NAT egress it can answer `403`. Both the installer and `gori update` fall back to the rate-limit-free release redirect automatically, so they keep working; you should see a line like `resolved v0.8.0 via ... (no API call)`.

To use the authenticated 5000/hour limit instead, export a token first. Note that it has to be exported rather than prefixed onto `curl`, because the script runs in the piped `bash`, which would not inherit a `curl`-scoped variable:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=<personal access token>
curl -fsSL https://gori.hahwul.com/install.sh | bash
```

`GORI_GITHUB_TOKEN` and `GH_TOKEN` work too, and `gori update` reads the same variables. Only a public-repo read scope is needed.

### Direct download (Dockerfiles, CI)

Every release also carries a version-less copy of each asset, so you can pull the latest build from a stable URL with no version lookup and no API call. These start at v0.2.0; earlier releases only carry the versioned names:

```bash
# Linux x86_64 / arm64: a static binary
curl -fsSL -o gori https://github.com/hahwul/gori/releases/latest/download/gori-linux-x86_64 && chmod +x gori

# macOS arm64 / x86_64: a tarball holding gori plus its lib/
curl -fsSL -o gori.tar.gz https://github.com/hahwul/gori/releases/latest/download/gori-osx-arm64.tar.gz

# Windows x86_64: a self-contained .exe
curl -fsSL -o gori.exe https://github.com/hahwul/gori/releases/latest/download/gori-windows-x86_64.exe
```

The versioned names (`gori-v0.8.0-linux-x86_64`) stay published alongside them; use those when you want to pin a build.

Each release also publishes a `SHA256SUMS` listing every asset under both naming schemes. The installer and `gori update` check against it automatically; to verify a direct download yourself:

```bash
curl -fsSL -O https://github.com/hahwul/gori/releases/latest/download/SHA256SUMS
sha256sum -c --ignore-missing SHA256SUMS       # Linux
shasum -a 256 -c --ignore-missing SHA256SUMS   # macOS
```

## Homebrew

Works on **macOS** (Apple Silicon & Intel) and **Linux** (x86_64 & arm64):

```bash
brew install hahwul/gori/gori
```

That is shorthand for tapping first, which you can also do explicitly:

```bash
brew tap hahwul/gori
brew install gori
```

The macOS bottle is a self-contained tarball with every linked dylib bundled next to the binary, and the Linux bottle is a static build. Neither pulls extra Homebrew dependencies.

## Chocolatey (Windows)

Install gori from the [Chocolatey community repository](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/gori):

```powershell
choco install gori
```

The package ships the Windows x86_64 binary, available from v0.8.0. `gori update` recognizes a Chocolatey install and prints `choco upgrade gori -y`. Run that from an elevated shell with gori closed, since Windows will not replace a running `gori.exe`.

## Arch Linux (AUR)

A binary package is published to the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gori) for **x86_64**. Install it with your favorite AUR helper:

```bash
yay -S gori
# or
paru -S gori
```

## Snap

A strictly confined snap is published to the Snap Store with every release, for **Linux x86_64**:

```bash
sudo snap install gori
```

Strict confinement keeps the snap out of hidden directories in your home, so its `GORI_HOME` (settings, root CA, project databases) is `~/snap/gori/common` rather than `~/.gori`. `gori update` recognises a snap install and prints `snap refresh gori` (`gori update --exec` runs it when a `snap` command is on `PATH`).

## Nix

The repository is a [flake](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Flakes), so you can run gori without installing it at all:

```bash
nix run github:hahwul/gori
```

Install it into your profile instead:

```bash
nix profile install github:hahwul/gori
```

Or pin it as an input to a NixOS / home-manager configuration:

```nix
{
  inputs.gori.url = "github:hahwul/gori";

  # then, in your package list:
  #   inputs.gori.packages.${pkgs.system}.default

  # or add the overlay once, and `pkgs.gori` works everywhere, no ${system} at
  # each use site, and gori is built against the same nixpkgs as the rest of the
  # configuration:
  #   nixpkgs.overlays = [ inputs.gori.overlays.default ];
}
```

Unlike the other channels this one **builds from source**. nixpkgs is still a Crystal release behind what gori needs, so the flake pins its own compiler and a cold build compiles that too: several minutes, cached from then on. Brotli and Zstd decoding are included, and nothing else is needed on the host.

Covers Linux (x86_64 and arm64) and Apple Silicon macOS. nixpkgs has dropped Intel macOS, so on those machines use [Homebrew](#homebrew) or a [pre-built binary](#pre-built-binary).

`nix develop` gives you a shell with Crystal, shards, `just` and the linked libraries, which is all you need to [hack on gori itself](https://github.com/hahwul/gori/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Docker

Multi-arch images (x86_64 & arm64) are published to the GitHub Container Registry as [`ghcr.io/hahwul/gori`](https://github.com/hahwul/gori/pkgs/container/gori).

The TUI needs a terminal, so run it interactively. Mount a volume at `/data` (that's `GORI_HOME` inside the container) so your settings and root CA survive restarts, and bind to `0.0.0.0` so the proxy is reachable from your host:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -v gori:/data \
  -p 8070:8070 \
  ghcr.io/hahwul/gori --listen 0.0.0.0
```

> Without a mounted `/data` volume the root CA is regenerated on every run, and must be re-trusted each time. The default bind host is `127.0.0.1`, which is not reachable from outside the container, hence `--listen 0.0.0.0`.

Headless subcommands don't need a TTY:

```bash
docker run --rm    -v gori:/data ghcr.io/hahwul/gori run history
docker run --rm -i -v gori:/data ghcr.io/hahwul/gori mcp
```

Times render in UTC by default. Pass a zone name to get local ones:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v gori:/data -p 8070:8070 -e TZ=Asia/Seoul \
  ghcr.io/hahwul/gori --listen 0.0.0.0
```

### Apple container

Apple's [`container`](https://github.com/apple/container) (macOS 26+, Apple Silicon) runs the same image with the same flags. `-v gori:/data` creates the named volume for you, `-it` gives the TUI its terminal, and `-i` is all `gori mcp` needs:

```bash
container run --rm -it \
  -v gori:/data \
  -p 8070:8070 \
  ghcr.io/hahwul/gori --listen 0.0.0.0
```

Every container also gets its own IP on the host's `vmnet` network, so publishing a port is optional: `container ls` prints the address, and pointing your client's proxy straight at `<ip>:8070` works just as well.

`container build -f packaging/docker/Dockerfile -t gori:dev .` builds the image from source, and reads `packaging/docker/Dockerfile.dockerignore` — a Dockerfile-adjacent ignore list is the only one it looks for, so unlike BuildKit it never falls back to a `.dockerignore` at the context root. The builder runs in its own VM, which does not inherit the host's `HTTP_PROXY` and defaults to 2 CPUs and 2 GB (`container builder status`). A `--release` build of gori runs well over an hour at that size, so give it more first:

```bash
container builder stop
container builder start --cpus 8 --memory 8g
```

## Pre-built Binary

Standalone binaries for macOS and Linux are attached to every [GitHub Release](https://github.com/hahwul/gori/releases/latest), and for Windows (x86_64) from v0.8.0. [Platform Support](/reference/platform-support/) lists what each platform's tier promises and the known gaps on Windows.

| Platform | Asset |
|----------|-------|
| Linux x86_64 | `gori-v*-linux-x86_64` |
| Linux arm64 | `gori-v*-linux-arm64` |
| macOS Apple Silicon | `gori-v*-osx-arm64.tar.gz` |
| macOS Intel | `gori-v*-osx-x86_64.tar.gz` |
| Windows x86_64 | `gori-v*-windows-x86_64.exe` |

### Linux

The Linux binaries are statically linked (musl) and self-contained. Download one, make it executable, and move it onto your `PATH`:

```bash
chmod +x gori-v*-linux-x86_64
sudo mv gori-v*-linux-x86_64 /usr/local/bin/gori
```

### macOS

The macOS archive is self-contained. It bundles every dependent dylib in a `lib/` folder next to the binary, which resolves them relative to itself. **Keep `gori` and `lib/` together.** Extract it into a stable location and link the binary onto your `PATH`:

```bash
tar xzf gori-v*-osx-arm64.tar.gz          # extracts `gori` + `lib/`
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/opt/gori
sudo cp -R gori lib /usr/local/opt/gori/
sudo ln -sf /usr/local/opt/gori/gori /usr/local/bin/gori
```

> The binaries are ad-hoc signed. If Gatekeeper blocks the download, clear the quarantine flag: `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /usr/local/opt/gori`. Installing via [Homebrew](#homebrew) avoids this.

### Windows

The Windows binary is statically linked: nothing else to install, and no DLL beside it. Rename it to `gori.exe` and put it in a folder on your `PATH`:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\gori" | Out-Null
Move-Item gori-v*-windows-x86_64.exe "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\gori\gori.exe"
# then add that folder to your user PATH (Settings → Environment Variables)
```

Run the TUI in Windows Terminal (or any console that speaks VT sequences, which every Windows 10 1809+ console does). `gori update` replaces the `.exe` in place. `GORI_HOME` defaults to `%USERPROFILE%\.gori`.

## Build from Source

### Prerequisites

- **Crystal** `>= 1.21.0`
- **pkg-config**
- **Git**, to clone the repository

#### System libraries (Brotli / Zstd)

By default gori links against native decoders so it can display HTTP bodies sent with `Content-Encoding: br` (Brotli) and `zstd`. Install them before building:

| Platform | Command |
|----------|---------|
| macOS (Homebrew) | `brew install brotli zstd` |
| Debian / Ubuntu | `sudo apt install libbrotli-dev libzstd-dev` |

### Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hahwul/gori
cd gori
shards build --release
```

The release binary is written to `bin/gori`. Move it somewhere on your `PATH`:

```bash
cp bin/gori /usr/local/bin/
```

### Building without Brotli / Zstd

If those libraries are unavailable, build without them. Gzip and deflate decoding (from the Crystal standard library) keep working; Brotli and Zstd bodies show a "decoder not built in" note instead of decoded text:

```bash
shards build --release -Dwithout_native_codecs
```

> If linking fails with undefined `BrotliDecoder*` symbols, `libbrotlidec` is missing or `pkg-config` cannot find it. Install `brotli` (see above) or use `-Dwithout_native_codecs`.

### Building on Windows

Crystal's Windows installer ships every library gori links except SQLite (with FTS5), Brotli and Zstd. Take those from [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/) as static libraries, and build with `--static` so the static C runtime matches them:

```bash
vcpkg install --triplet x64-windows-static "sqlite3[fts5]" brotli zstd
export CRYSTAL_LIBRARY_PATH="$(crystal env CRYSTAL_LIBRARY_PATH);C:\vcpkg\installed\x64-windows-static\lib"
shards install
crystal build src/main.cr -o bin/gori.exe --release --static
```

## Verify the Installation

```bash
gori --version
```

You should see `gori 0.8.0`.

## Run Without Installing

During development you can run directly from a checkout:

```bash
shards run gori
```
