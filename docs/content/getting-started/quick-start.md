This is a follow-along tutorial. Work through it top to bottom and you'll go from a fresh install to a captured HTTPS request that you have inspected, sent to **Repeater**, edited, and re-sent, all without leaving the terminal. Set aside about ten minutes.

Each step ends with a **Checkpoint**: what you should see before moving on. If something looks different, that line is where to stop and fix it.

> **Before you begin.** [Install gori](/getting-started/installation/) and have a browser installed. You'll capture your own browsing, so pick a site you are authorized to test (your own app, a staging box, or a deliberately vulnerable practice target). The examples use a stable throwaway target, `example.com`, for the parts that need an exact result.

## 1. Start gori

With no subcommand, gori opens the project picker. The proxy starts when you open a project:

```bash
gori
```

The first launch runs a short [setup wizard](#first-run-wizard) (global bind, theme, and the Miss Ring mascot), then offers a [guided UI tour](#guided-ui-tour). You can take the tour now or skip it and come back; this page covers the same ground against live traffic.

At the picker, select **New project**, enter a name, then press `Enter` twice (the description is optional). The guided tour returns you to this picker when it finishes on first launch.

To find which project captured something (a token, a host, an endpoint), press `Ctrl-F` at the picker and type it. gori searches the flows of every project by host and path, and by body text once you have typed three characters, then lists the hits under each project. `Enter` opens that project with the flow's detail showing. `Esc` stops a search that is still running, and closes the search once it has finished.

By default the proxy listens on `127.0.0.1:8070`. Override it for a single run (a project's own bind still wins when set):

```bash
gori --listen 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

**Checkpoint.** Your project session is open on **History**. The tab bar shows Project, Target, History, …, and the top bar shows the proxy address, `127.0.0.1:8070`.

## 2. Trust the CA and capture your first flow

To read HTTPS, the client has to trust gori's root certificate (generated on first run under `~/.gori/ca`). The fastest path is a pre-trusted browser.

### Option A: Open a pre-trusted browser (recommended)

Inside the TUI:

1. Press `Ctrl-P` to open the **command palette**.
2. Type `browser` and run **Open browser**.
3. Pick an installed browser (Chrome, Chromium, Brave, Edge, Firefox, …).

gori launches it with a throwaway profile that already trusts the CA and routes HTTP/HTTPS through the proxy. In that browser, visit a site (try `https://example.com`, then a site you're testing).

> **Firefox note.** Auto-trusting the CA needs `certutil` (NSS) on `PATH`. Without it, gori still sets the proxy but Firefox won't trust the CA, so HTTPS sites show a security warning. Either install it first (`brew install nss` on macOS, `apt install libnss3-tools` on Debian/Ubuntu, `dnf install nss-tools` on Fedora) and reopen the browser, or trust the CA by hand in that same window: open `about:preferences#privacy`, click **View Certificates**, go to **Authorities**, then **Import** the file `gori ca` prints.

### Option B: Point any client yourself

Print the CA path and import that file into your system or browser trust store as a **trusted root CA**:

```bash
gori ca
```

Then set the client's HTTP **and** HTTPS proxy to `127.0.0.1:8070`. Quick smoke test from another terminal:

```bash
curl -x http://127.0.0.1:8070 https://example.com
```

gori mints per-host leaf certificates from the root on demand, so you trust the root only once.

For command-line tools there is a shortcut: `gori run shell` (or **Open shell** in the palette) starts a shell whose curl, git, Python, Go and Node traffic already goes through the running gori and trusts its CA, without touching OS settings. `gori run shell -- curl https://example.com` runs one command that way. See [`gori run shell`](/reference/cli/#run-shell).

> gori's private key is a machine secret, written with `0600` permissions, and never leaves your machine. Rotate it from the palette (**Regenerate CA certificate**) only when you mean to invalidate every prior trust.

### Option C: Install the CA on a phone or tablet

A phone can't read the CA off your filesystem, so gori serves it over the network instead.

1. Bind the proxy so the device can reach it, and note your machine's LAN IP:

   ```bash
   gori --listen 0.0.0.0 --port 8070
   ```

2. On the device, set the WiFi HTTP **and** HTTPS proxy to `<your-LAN-IP>:8070`.
3. Open a browser there and go to **`http://gori.proxy/`** (`http://gori/` works too).
4. Download the certificate and trust it. On iOS that is two steps: install the profile, then enable it under **Settings → General → About → Certificate Trust Settings**. On Android, install it under **Settings → Security → Encryption & credentials → Install a certificate → CA certificate**.

`gori.proxy` is a reserved name gori answers for itself, so it works once the proxy is configured and never reaches the network. If you'd rather not configure the proxy first, browse straight to `http://<your-LAN-IP>:8070/` instead and you'll get the same page.

**Checkpoint.** Switch to **History** (press `3`). You should see at least one row: your `GET https://example.com/` request with a `200` status. If History is empty, capture isn't reaching gori: recheck the proxy setting (Option B) or use **Open browser** (Option A).

## 3. Learn the two discovery surfaces

You don't need to memorize tab-specific keys. Two keys reach every action:

| Surface | Key | What it is for |
|---------|-----|----------------|
| **Space menu** | `Space` | What you do most in the pane you are in (a History row, a flow's detail, the Repeater editor, …), one letter per action |
| **Command palette** | `Ctrl-P` | Every action, found by typing its name: the pane's own actions first, then app-wide ones such as settings and **Open browser** |

Both show each action's shortcut beside it, so opening them is also how you learn the keys. Try it now on the flow you just captured:

1. In **History**, press `↓` to select your flow, then `Space`. The letter on the left of a row runs it; the key on the right (`^R` beside **Repeater flow**) does the same without the menu. A row marked `›`, such as `>` **Send flow to…**, opens a second card; `Esc` steps back. Press `Esc` until the menu closes.
2. Press `Ctrl-P` and type `send`. The History actions come first under `THIS TAB`, each with the key or menu path that reaches it (`␣ > c` means `Space`, `>`, `c`). Press `Esc`.

  <img src="/images/tui/command-palette.svg" alt="gori command palette over the History tab with the query send: THIS TAB lists the send actions with their keys or menu paths, then APP lists matching app commands">
  <figcaption>The command palette (<kbd>Ctrl-P</kbd>) with <code>send</code> typed on History: the tab's own actions first, each with the shorter route to it, then app-wide commands.</figcaption>
</figure>

[Space Menu & Palette](/guide/space-menu-and-palette/) covers both in depth, including the `Z` **Display…** and `P` **Protocol…** cards and the actions that only the palette lists.

Three global toggles are worth knowing from the start:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `c` | Toggle **capture** (off = traffic passes through without being stored) |
| `i` | Toggle **intercept** (hold matching requests to forward / drop / edit) |
| `s` | Toggle the **scope lens** (filter views to in-scope traffic) |

## 4. Move around the TUI

gori is a row of tabs. The default order starts Project → Target → **History** → Intercept → Repeater → Fuzzer → …

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `[` / `]` | Previous / next tab |
| `1`-`9` | Jump to the Nth visible tab (with defaults, History is `3`) |
| `Enter` / `↓` | Enter the tab body from the tab bar |
| `Esc` | Pop focus back toward the tab bar |
| `Tab` / `Shift-Tab` | Move focus between the tab bar and panes |

Mouse works when enabled (Preferences → **Editor & Keys** → **Mouse**): click a tab, click a row to select, click again to open. The **Help** tab is a full key cheatsheet inside the app when this page isn't open.

## 5. Read a flow in History

Make sure History is active (`3`). Every request/response is a *flow*: start line, headers, body (stored up to 2 MiB), plus HTTP/2 frames, WebSocket messages, and decoded JWT / SAML / GraphQL when present.

<figure class="tui-shot">
  <img src="/images/tui/history.svg" alt="gori History tab listing captured HTTP flows with time, method, protocol, host, path, status, type, size and duration columns">
  <figcaption>The <strong>History</strong> tab: every captured flow with method, status, size and timing, filterable with the query language.</figcaption>
</figure>

Try each of these:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑` / `↓` (or `j` / `k`) | Move the selection |
| `Enter` | Open request/response detail |
| `/` | Filter with the [query language](/reference/query-language/) |
| `Space` `Z` `f` | Toggle follow-newest (tail) |
| `y` | Copy the selected flow |

Press `/` and type a filter, then `Enter`:

```text
host:example.com
```

History narrows to that host. Clear the filter (`/`, erase, `Enter`) to see everything again. A few more to try later:

```text
status:5xx
method:POST body:password
```

Now select your `example.com` flow and press `Enter`. In the detail view, scroll with `↑` / `↓`, copy with `y`, and toggle `Ctrl-X` / `b` / `p` for hex / whitespace / pretty bodies. `Esc` returns to the list.

**Checkpoint.** You can filter History down to one host and open a flow to read its full request and response.

## 6. Send it to Repeater and re-send (the core loop)

This is the loop you'll spend most of your time in: take a captured request, change something, send it again, and compare.

1. In **History**, select your `example.com` flow.
2. Press `Ctrl-R`. gori copies it into the **Repeater** tab and switches you there.
3. Press `Enter` or `i` on the request pane to edit (INS mode). Change something small, for example add a header line:
   ```http
   X-Gori-Test: 1
   ```
4. Press `Esc` to leave edit mode, then `Ctrl-R` to **send**.

   Copying while you edit: `Shift`+arrows select in both modes, but the copy key differs. In READ it is `y`; in INS `y` is a literal character, and typing it over a selection *replaces* the selection, so use **`Ctrl-Y`**. `Esc` also carries the selection out of INS, so `Esc` then `y` works too. If a keystroke does eat a selection, `Ctrl-Z` puts it back in one step.
5. The response, its timing, and a diff against the previous reply appear on the right. `Tab` cycles target → request → response.

<figure class="tui-shot">
  <img src="/images/tui/repeater.svg" alt="gori Repeater tab showing an editable request pane beside the response pane, with a status line reading sent → 200 in 114ms">
  <figcaption><strong>Repeater</strong> edits any part of a request and re-sends it; the response, timing, and a diff against the last reply sit side by side.</figcaption>
</figure>

**Checkpoint.** The Repeater status line reads something like `sent → 200 in … ms`, and you can re-send with `Ctrl-R` as many times as you like. That is the full capture → inspect → replay loop.

## 7. Where to go next

You now have the core loop. From here, the [Playbooks](/playbooks/) walk one workflow at a time (scope, map, intercept, fuzz, and report), each run end to end with checkpoints. A few first directions, also covered in depth in the [Guide](/guide/):

- **Fuzz a parameter.** Select a flow, press `Shift-I` to send it to the **Fuzzer**, mark a position (`Ctrl-A` auto-marks common params), attach a wordlist, and `Ctrl-R` to run. See [Repeater & Fuzzer](/guide/repeater-and-fuzzer/).
- **Intercept and edit in flight.** Press `i` to hold matching requests and forward, drop, or modify them before they continue. See [Proxy & History](/guide/proxy/#intercept).
- **Track what you find.** Turn anything worth reporting into an **Issue** with `Shift-F`, and read passive findings on the **Probe** tab as you browse. See [Scanning & Issues](/guide/scanning/).

## Day-1 key map

Keep this table nearby until the chords stick:

| Key | Where | Action |
|-----|--------|--------|
| `Space` | Focused pane | Space menu: this pane's actions, one letter each |
| `Ctrl-P` | Anywhere | Command palette: type any action's name |
| `?` | Anywhere | Help: the full key sheet |
| `Ctrl-,` | Anywhere | Preferences (all settings in one modal) |
| `c` / `i` / `s` | Anywhere | Capture / intercept / scope lens |
| `[` `]` · `1`-`9` | Anywhere | Switch tabs |
| `/` | History | Query-language filter |
| `Enter` | History | Open flow detail |
| `Ctrl-R` | History | → Repeater |
| `Shift-I` | History | → Fuzzer |
| `>` | History | Send flow to… any tool (`>` `c` → Comparer) |
| `Ctrl-R` | Repeater / Fuzzer | Send request / run fuzz |
| `Esc` | Most places | Back out one level |

## First-run wizard

Re-run the guided setup (global proxy bind default, then theme, then Miss Ring) at any time:

```bash
gori wizard
```

The listen IP defaults to `127.0.0.1` (this computer only); `0.0.0.0` lets other devices reach the proxy. The first `Enter` moves from IP to port, and the next continues. The choice becomes the shared default in `settings.json`; a project can pin a different address from its Project tab. If the port is busy, `Enter` again keeps it. `Esc` twice skips the wizard.

The final **Review** step recaps what you picked, names your [editor keyset](/guide/hotkeys/#editor-keysets) and where to change it (the wizard never sets it), and carries one editable row: **Shortcuts**, which `←`/`→` flips between `Ctrl` and `Option (⌥)` for gori's built-in chord family (`^P` `^N` `^W` `^1-9`). Choosing Option *adds* `⌥` aliases rather than replacing Ctrl, which is useful when your terminal or multiplexer never delivers the Ctrl form. See [Command modifier](/guide/hotkeys/#command-modifier) for the macOS Option-as-Meta requirement.

## Guided UI tour

A mock-UI walkthrough of tab/pane navigation, the space menu (including its second cards), the command palette's search, READ/INS edit mode, then the traffic itself: where to point a client and how to trust the CA, the capture switch, and intercept. It is safe to run without a live proxy session. Each lesson shows a short demo and asks you to try the real key; a hands-on sandbox covers the first four moves, and the tour ends with Help and quitting, then a first-session checklist. The mock menus use the same letters and keys as your install, rebinds included.

```bash

  <figcaption>The guided tour walks through tabs and panes, the space menu, the palette, and READ / INS edit mode. Try each key, then practice all four in a harmless sandbox.</figcaption>
</figure>

It is also offered at the end of the first-run wizard, and from inside a session as the palette command **Guided tour** (`Ctrl-P`). Its last card tells you whether finishing leads to the project picker, a `--db` session, the shell, or your current session.
