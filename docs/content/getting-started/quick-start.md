This is a follow-along tutorial. Work through it top to bottom and you'll go from a fresh install to a captured HTTPS request that you have inspected, sent to **Repeater**, edited, and re-sent, all without leaving the terminal. Set aside about ten minutes.

Each step ends with a **Checkpoint**: what you should see before moving on. If something looks different, that line is where to stop and fix it.

> **Before you begin.** [Install gori](/getting-started/installation/) and have a browser installed. You'll capture your own browsing, so pick a site you are authorized to test (your own app, a staging box, or a deliberately vulnerable practice target). The examples use a stable throwaway target, `example.com`, for the parts that need an exact result.

## 1. Start gori

With no subcommand, gori starts the proxy and opens the interface:

```bash
gori
```

The first launch runs a short [setup wizard](#first-run-wizard) (global bind, theme, and the Miss Ring mascot), then offers a [guided UI tour](#guided-ui-tour). You can take the tour now or skip it and come back; this page covers the same ground against live traffic.

By default the proxy listens on `127.0.0.1:8070`. Override it for a single run (a project's own bind still wins when set):

```bash
gori --listen 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

**Checkpoint.** You're looking at the gori TUI: a row of tabs down the side (Project, Target, History, …) and a top bar showing the proxy address, `127.0.0.1:8070`.

## 2. Trust the CA and capture your first flow

To read HTTPS, the client has to trust gori's root certificate (generated on first run under `~/.gori/ca`). The fastest path is a pre-trusted browser.

### Option A: Open a pre-trusted browser (recommended)

Inside the TUI:

1. Press `Ctrl-P` to open the **command palette**.
2. Type `browser` and run **Open browser**.
3. Pick an installed browser (Chrome, Chromium, Brave, Edge, Firefox, …).

gori launches it with a throwaway profile that already trusts the CA and routes HTTP/HTTPS through the proxy. In that browser, visit a site (try `https://example.com`, then a site you're testing).

> **Firefox note.** Auto-trusting the CA needs `certutil` (NSS) on `PATH`. Without it, gori still sets the proxy but Firefox won't trust the CA, so HTTPS sites show a security warning. Either install it first (`brew install nss` on macOS, `apt install libnss3-tools` on Debian/Ubuntu, `dnf install nss-tools` on Fedora) and reopen the browser, or trust the CA by hand in that same window: open `about:preferences#privacy`, click **View Certificates**, go to **Authorities**, then **Import** the file `gori ca` prints.

### Option B: Point any client yourself

Print the CA path and import that file into your system or browser trust store as a **trusted root CA**:

```bash
gori ca
```

Then set the client's HTTP **and** HTTPS proxy to `127.0.0.1:8070`. Quick smoke test from another terminal:

```bash
curl -x http://127.0.0.1:8070 https://example.com
```

gori mints per-host leaf certificates from the root on demand, so you trust the root only once.

> gori's private key is a machine secret, written with `0600` permissions, and never leaves your machine. Rotate it from the palette (**Regenerate CA certificate**) only when you mean to invalidate every prior trust.

### Option C: Install the CA on a phone or tablet

A phone can't read the CA off your filesystem, so gori serves it over the network instead.

1. Bind the proxy so the device can reach it, and note your machine's LAN IP:

   ```bash
   gori --listen 0.0.0.0 --port 8070
   ```

2. On the device, set the WiFi HTTP **and** HTTPS proxy to `<your-LAN-IP>:8070`.
3. Open a browser there and go to **`http://gori.proxy/`** (`http://gori/` works too).
4. Download the certificate and trust it. On iOS that is two steps: install the profile, then enable it under **Settings → General → About → Certificate Trust Settings**. On Android, install it under **Settings → Security → Encryption & credentials → Install a certificate → CA certificate**.

`gori.proxy` is a reserved name gori answers for itself, so it works once the proxy is configured and never reaches the network. If you'd rather not configure the proxy first, browse straight to `http://<your-LAN-IP>:8070/` instead and you'll get the same page.

**Checkpoint.** Switch to **History** (press `3`). You should see at least one row: your `GET https://example.com/` request with a `200` status. If History is empty, capture isn't reaching gori: recheck the proxy setting (Option B) or use **Open browser** (Option A).

## 3. Learn the two discovery surfaces

Before memorizing tab-specific keys, learn the two places almost everything lives.

| Surface | Key | What it is for |
|---------|-----|----------------|
| **Command palette** | `Ctrl-P` | App-wide control: settings, Open browser, Export CA, jump actions, anything global |
| **Space menu** | `Space` | Actions for whatever has focus right now (History row, detail pane, Repeater, …) |

The palette is the map of the whole tool. The space menu is the map of *this* pane. Both show key hints, so if you forget a chord, open one of them.

<figure class="tui-shot">
  <img src="/images/tui/command-palette.svg" alt="gori command palette open over the History tab, listing settings, navigation and export actions with a filter box">
  <figcaption>The command palette (<kbd>Ctrl-P</kbd>): fuzzy-filter every app-wide action, from settings to <em>Open browser</em> to tab jumps.</figcaption>
</figure>

Three global toggles are worth knowing from the start:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `c` | Toggle **capture** (off = traffic passes through without being stored) |
| `i` | Toggle **intercept** (hold matching requests to forward / drop / edit) |
| `s` | Toggle the **scope lens** (filter views to in-scope traffic) |

## 4. Move around the TUI

gori is a row of tabs. The default order starts Project → Target → **History** → Intercept → Repeater → Fuzzer → …

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `[` / `]` | Previous / next tab |
| `1`-`9` | Jump to the Nth visible tab (with defaults, History is `3`) |
| `Enter` / `↓` | Enter the tab body from the tab bar |
| `Esc` | Pop focus back toward the tab bar |
| `Tab` / `Shift-Tab` | Move focus between the tab bar and panes |

Mouse works when enabled (Preferences → **Editor & Keys** → **Editor**): click a tab, click a row to select, click again to open. The **Help** tab is a full key cheatsheet inside the app when this page isn't open.

## 5. Read a flow in History

Make sure History is active (`3`). Every request/response is a *flow*: start line, headers, body (stored up to 2 MiB), plus HTTP/2 frames, WebSocket messages, and decoded JWT / SAML / GraphQL when present.

<figure class="tui-shot">
  <img src="/images/tui/history.svg" alt="gori History tab listing captured HTTP flows with time, method, protocol, host, path, status, type, size and duration columns">
  <figcaption>The <strong>History</strong> tab: every captured flow with method, status, size and timing, filterable with the query language.</figcaption>
</figure>

Try each of these:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑` / `↓` (or `j` / `k`) | Move the selection |
| `Enter` | Open request/response detail |
| `/` | Filter with the [query language](/reference/query-language/) |
| `f` | Toggle follow-newest (tail) |
| `y` | Copy the selected flow |

Press `/` and type a filter, then `Enter`:

```text
host:example.com
```

History narrows to that host. Clear the filter (`/`, erase, `Enter`) to see everything again. A few more to try later:

```text
status:5xx
method:POST body:password
```

Now select your `example.com` flow and press `Enter`. In the detail view, scroll with `↑` / `↓`, copy with `y`, and toggle `x` / `b` / `p` for hex / whitespace / pretty bodies. `Esc` returns to the list.

**Checkpoint.** You can filter History down to one host and open a flow to read its full request and response.

## 6. Send it to Repeater and re-send (the core loop)

This is the loop you'll spend most of your time in: take a captured request, change something, send it again, and compare.

1. In **History**, select your `example.com` flow.
2. Press `Ctrl-R`. gori copies it into the **Repeater** tab and switches you there.
3. Press `Enter` or `i` on the request pane to edit (INS mode). Change something small, for example add a header line:
   ```http
   X-Gori-Test: 1
   ```
4. Press `Esc` to leave edit mode, then `Ctrl-R` to **send**.

   Copying while you edit: `Shift`+arrows select in both modes, but the copy key differs. In READ it is `y`; in INS `y` is a literal character, and typing it over a selection *replaces* the selection, so use **`Ctrl-Y`**. `Esc` also carries the selection out of INS, so `Esc` then `y` works too. If a keystroke does eat a selection, `Ctrl-Z` puts it back in one step.
5. The response, its timing, and a diff against the previous reply appear on the right. `Tab` cycles target → request → response.

<figure class="tui-shot">
  <img src="/images/tui/repeater.svg" alt="gori Repeater tab showing an editable request pane beside the response pane, with a status line reading replayed 200 in 1152ms">
  <figcaption><strong>Repeater</strong> edits any part of a request and re-sends it; the response, timing, and a diff against the last reply sit side by side.</figcaption>
</figure>

**Checkpoint.** The Repeater status line reads something like `replayed 200 in … ms`, and you can re-send with `Ctrl-R` as many times as you like. That is the full capture → inspect → replay loop.

## 7. Where to go next

You now have the core loop. From here, the [Playbooks](/playbooks/) walk one workflow at a time (scope, map, intercept, fuzz, and report), each run end to end with checkpoints. A few first directions, also covered in depth in the [Guide](/guide/):

- **Fuzz a parameter.** Select a flow, press `Shift-I` to send it to the **Fuzzer**, mark a position (`Ctrl-A` auto-marks common params), attach a wordlist, and `Ctrl-R` to run. See [Repeater & Fuzzer](/guide/repeater-and-fuzzer/).
- **Intercept and edit in flight.** Press `i` to hold matching requests and forward, drop, or modify them before they continue. See [Proxy & History](/guide/proxy/#intercept).
- **Track what you find.** Turn anything worth reporting into an **Issue** with `Shift-F`, and read passive findings on the **Probe** tab as you browse. See [Scanning & Issues](/guide/scanning/).

## Day-1 key map

Keep this table nearby until the chords stick:

| Key | Where | Action |
|-----|--------|--------|
| `Ctrl-P` | Anywhere | Command palette (settings, Match & Replace, notifications, …) |
| `Ctrl-,` | Anywhere | Preferences (all settings in one modal) |
| `Space` | Focused pane | Area action menu |
| `c` / `i` / `s` | Anywhere | Capture / intercept / scope lens |
| `[` `]` · `1`-`9` | Anywhere | Switch tabs |
| `/` | History | Query-language filter |
| `Enter` | History | Open flow detail |
| `Ctrl-R` | History | → Repeater |
| `Shift-I` | History | → Fuzzer |
| `Ctrl-R` | Repeater / Fuzzer | Send request / run fuzz |
| `Esc` | Most places | Back out one level |

## First-run wizard

Re-run the guided setup (global proxy bind default, then theme, then Miss Ring) at any time:

```bash
gori wizard
```

The bind step sets the shared default in `settings.json`, the same layer as Preferences → **Network & Tabs** → **Network**. It is not a per-project lock; pin a different address per engagement from the Project tab when needed. If something already listens on the port you pick, the step says so; `Enter` again keeps it. `Esc` twice skips the wizard (the first press only arms it, so a stray `Esc` in a field cannot end setup).

The final **Review** step recaps what you picked and carries one editable row: **Shortcuts**, which `←`/`→` flips between `Ctrl` and `Option (⌥)` for gori's built-in chord family (`^P` `^N` `^W` `^1-9`). Choosing Option *adds* `⌥` aliases rather than replacing Ctrl, which is useful when your terminal or multiplexer never delivers the Ctrl form. See [Command modifier](/guide/hotkeys/#command-modifier) for the macOS Option-as-Meta requirement.

## Guided UI tour

A mock-UI walkthrough of tab/pane navigation, the palette, the space menu, and READ/INS edit mode. It is safe to run without a live proxy session. Each lesson shows a short demo and asks you to try the real key; the final step is a hands-on sandbox for all four moves, then a first-session checklist.

```bash
gori tutorial
```

  <figcaption>The guided tour walks through tabs and panes, the palette, the space menu, and READ / INS edit mode. Try each key, then practice all four in a harmless sandbox.</figcaption>
</figure>

It is also offered at the end of the first-run wizard, and from inside a session as the palette command **Guided tour** (`Ctrl-P`), which brings you back to where you were when it ends.

## Next Steps
