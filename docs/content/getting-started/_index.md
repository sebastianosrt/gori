Welcome to gori. This section takes you from a clean machine to a live proxy session: traffic in History, a few Day-1 keys under your fingers, and a first Repeater.

## What You'll Learn

1. How to install and build gori
2. Starting the proxy and trusting the root CA (including a pre-trusted browser)
3. Capturing, filtering, and inspecting your first flows
4. The two discovery surfaces: command palette (`Ctrl-P`) and space menu (`Space`)
5. Sending a flow to Repeater / Fuzzer and running one send
6. Where gori stores its data and how to configure it
7. Connecting an AI agent to the same project over MCP

## What Is gori?

gori (고리, Korean for *ring, link, loop*) is a keyboard-driven HTTP/HTTPS **intercepting proxy** and web-hacking toolkit that runs entirely in your terminal. It sits *in the loop* between your client and the target, records every request/response as a *flow*, and gives you a pentest workbench to inspect, replay, fuzz, and scan that traffic without leaving the shell.

It understands **HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, WebSocket, gRPC, and Server-Sent Events**, and decodes common formats inline: JWT, SAML, GraphQL, protobuf, MessagePack and CBOR. The core project and testing workflows use the same engines in the TUI, `gori run`, and the built-in [MCP server](/guide/mcp/), so agents and scripts can drive the same project without pretending that UI navigation is an API. See the [capability matrix](/reference/capabilities/) for the exact boundaries.

## Next Steps

- [Installation](/getting-started/installation/): Homebrew, the AUR, Nix, Docker, a binary, or from source
- [Quick Start](/getting-started/quick-start/): capture, keys, and your first Repeater
- [Playbooks](/playbooks/): follow-along lessons for each workflow, from scoping to reporting
- [AI Setup](/getting-started/ai-setup/): connect an AI agent to the project over MCP
- [Configuration](/getting-started/configuration/): settings, storage, and the CA
