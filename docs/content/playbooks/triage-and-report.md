By now you have findings scattered across the Probe tab, a Repeater tab, and your own memory. This playbook gathers them into something you can hand off: an issue with a severity, a diff that proves it, and a report a teammate can read without gori installed. Set aside about ten minutes. Almost nothing here sends new traffic; you work with what you already captured.

> **Before you begin.** You need an engagement with some captured or tested traffic worth writing up. Work through the earlier playbooks first, or bring a project of your own. The examples use `api.example.com` as a stand-in.

## 1. Skim passive findings

**Probe** runs its passive checks on every flow you capture and every Repeater send. They cost nothing extra (no request leaves your machine to produce them), so this is the cheapest place to start. Open the **Probe** tab: findings are grouped by check and host, so one row can stand for dozens of hits (permissive CORS, missing security headers, cookie hygiene, secrets in a URL, and the rest).

Open a row and the **AFFECTED URLS** list is the evidence: `↑`/`↓` walk it, `Enter` opens the flow that URL was captured on in the same detail view History uses, and `r` sends it to the Repeater to dig further.

Read the same set headless, which also sends nothing on its own:

```bash
gori run probe                       # passive findings only
gori run probe --severity high       # only the high-severity rows
gori run probe --category cors       # a single category
```

**Checkpoint.** The Probe tab lists findings grouped by severity and category, each one openable to the flow it came from, and History's request count did not move to produce them.

## 2. File an issue

**Issues** is the triage list you eventually hand to a report. Press `Shift-F` on a **History** flow or a Repeater send to file one; promote a **Probe** finding into an issue from the Probe tab. Give it a severity (`info` through `critical`) and a status (`open`, `confirmed`, `false-positive`, `resolved`). The flow you filed it from is linked as evidence, so the issue carries its own proof: `Enter` on the issue jumps straight back to that exchange.

</figure>

From a script, file and update issues directly; `--flow` links the evidence in the same move:

```bash
gori run issues create --title "IDOR on /v1/users/{id}" --severity high --host api.example.com --flow 42
gori run issues update 7 --status confirmed --notes "Verified on staging"
gori run probe promote 12            # confirm a Probe finding into Issues
```

**Checkpoint.** The **Issues** tab shows your issue with its severity, and opening it jumps to the evidence flow.

## 3. Prove it with the Comparer

A finding lands harder with the before and after side by side: the unauthenticated `403` next to the authenticated `200`, or the patched response next to the vulnerable one. The **Comparer** holds two messages, A and B, and diffs them.

Fill the slots from wherever a request and its response live. Select the first flow in **History** and press `Space` → **Send to Comparer**; it lands in slot A. Send the second the same way to fill slot B. A Repeater send or a Fuzzer result row goes in the same way, and since neither leaves a captured flow behind, this is their only route into a diff. On the Comparer tab itself, `a` / `b` pick a captured flow straight into either slot, through the active Scope lens, so an out-of-scope control needs the lens off.

The divider between the columns states the A→B delta before you read a line: a `403 → 200` is usually the whole answer. `←`/`→` switches between diffing the requests and the responses, and on a changed row only the bytes that actually differ are lit red and green, so one flipped value stands out without reading the line.

```bash
gori run compare 41 42 --pane response --changes-only
```

**Checkpoint.** The diff highlights the change that proves the finding: a status flip like `403 → 200`, or the one value that moved.

## 3b. Retest against the last engagement

The Comparer proves one message changed. A retest asks it of the whole surface: *what is new, what is gone, and what answers differently since last time?* If the previous assessment lives in its own gori project, that is one command.

```bash
gori run diff --from q1-audit --to q3-retest --format md
```

Endpoints are keyed by the same folded template the Sitemap draws (`/users/{uuid}`), so the identifiers each engagement happened to capture don't turn every row into an added/removed pair, and `changed` is judged by a tolerance band rather than byte equality, so a page whose length drifts is not a finding. Interactively it is **Target → Diff**: `a` picks the baseline, `↵` on a row hands both sides' captures to the Comparer for the byte-level detail.

Read the verdicts exactly. `gone` means the newer capture *asked* and got a `404`; `not seen` means it never asked, a gap in this retest's coverage, not a fix. The report closes with each still-open issue and what became of the endpoint it was filed against, without sending anything.

**Checkpoint.** `--format md` gives you a section you can paste straight into the retest deliverable, with both sides' coverage stated above the counts.

## 4. Keep notes and links

Not everything is an issue. **Notes** are free-form, per-project Markdown (multiple notes per project): a running log of what you tried, the payload that worked, the lead to return to. Create and edit them on the **Notes** tab.

To tie the loose evidence together, press `Space` → **Link…** from History, the Repeater, the Fuzzer, or the Miner. One card lists every issue *and* every note, with `+ New issue…` / `+ New note…` pinned above them, so attaching what you are looking at to an existing issue, or filing a fresh one already linked, is the same keystroke. Whatever you type filters by title, host, or status, and becomes the new issue's title if you land on the create row.

```bash
gori run notes create --text "SSRF candidate on /fetch, needs OAST to confirm"
gori run notes --all
```

**Checkpoint.** The Notes tab holds your note, and an issue you linked lists the evidence flow or session under it.

## 5. Export the report

When the issues are triaged, export them as a single Markdown document a teammate can read without gori installed:

```bash
gori run issues --format markdown --export report.md
```

In the TUI the same report is `⇧E` on the Issues tab: pick the format, then the destination path.

When the report is going to a machine rather than a person, export SARIF instead, the format GitHub code scanning, DefectDojo and Azure DevOps ingest:

```bash
gori run issues --format sarif --export issues.sarif
gh api -X POST /repos/OWNER/REPO/code-scanning/sarifs \
  -f commit_sha="$(git rev-parse HEAD)" -f ref=refs/heads/main \
  -f sarif="$(gzip -c issues.sarif | base64 | tr -d '\n')"
```

Each issue arrives as one result carrying its URL, its severity, and, when you linked a flow, the actual request and response as `webRequest`/`webResponse`. An issue you triaged to `false-positive` or `resolved` exports as a SARIF *suppression*, so dismissing a finding in gori dismisses it in the dashboard rather than filing it again.

To hand over the raw traffic behind a finding, and not only the write-up, export a History query as one HAR log. It writes to STDOUT, loads into Burp, Charles, or a browser's network panel, and imports straight back into gori:

```bash
gori run history -q 'host:api.example.com status:200' --format har > evidence.har
```

**Checkpoint.** `report.md` exists on disk and reads as a severity-ordered list of your issues; `evidence.har` carries the flows behind them. If you exported SARIF, `jq '.runs[0].results | length' issues.sarif` matches your issue count.
