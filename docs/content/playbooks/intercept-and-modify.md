Repeater edits a copy after the fact; intercept edits the real request while the client waits. This playbook holds a live request, changes it on the wire, forwards it, and then, once you know the edit is worth keeping, turns it into a Match & Replace rule that applies itself with intercept off. It takes about ten minutes.

> **Before you begin.** Have an engagement [set up](/playbooks/set-up-an-engagement/) with scope drawn, capture on (`c`), and a client pointed at the proxy. The examples use `api.example.com`.

## 1. Arm intercept

Press `i` to toggle **Intercept** on, or open the **Intercept** tab and arm the catch there. A blank condition holds *everything* (every request through the proxy stalls until you decide it), so narrow it in the filter bar with a query-language expression before you turn it loose:

```text
host:api.example.com method:POST
```

Now only the POSTs to your target are held; the rest pass straight through. The same tokens the History filter speaks work here (`host:`, `path:`, `method:`, `scheme:`, `status:`, plus `AND` / `OR` / `NOT`).

</figure>

> **WebSocket is the exception.** A WebSocket message is held **only** when the catch condition contains `proto:ws`; nothing else arms it, not a blank condition and not a host filter. That is the opposite of the HTTP rule, and deliberate: a chat or trading socket carrying dozens of messages a second, frozen because you typed a host filter, is not a state you can drain your way out of.

**Checkpoint.** The Intercept tab shows catch is on, and your condition sits in the filter bar.

## 2. Catch a request and edit it

Trigger the matching request from your client: a browser click, a `curl`, a Repeater send. Instead of leaving, it stops in the Intercept queue. Select it and open its raw bytes in the editor (the same INS-mode editor the Repeater uses via the `Space` menu), change what you need (a header value, a JSON field, the path), then release it with `f` to **forward** the edited request. `Esc` leaves the editor without sending.

Headless, the same queue is drivable from a second terminal against a running TUI:

```bash
gori run intercept                       # list held items + catch state
gori run intercept edit 3 --raw-file edited.txt   # forward item 3 with edited bytes
```

An edited request is forwarded with `Content-Length` resynced, and no `$KEY` expansion; what you typed is what goes out.

**Checkpoint.** The edited request reaches the origin: switch to **History** and read the flow to confirm the change and the origin's response.

## 3. Forward, drop, or edit

Every held item is one of three decisions, and gori applies none of them for you:

- **Forward** (`f`) releases the item byte-exact, or with your edits from step 2. `Shift-F` forwards the whole queue at once when a burst has piled up.
- **Drop** (`d`) kills it: on HTTP/1.1 the client gets a canned `502`, on HTTP/2 the stream is cancelled. Use it to see how the client copes when a request never lands.
- **Edit, then forward** is for the request you want to change before it continues, the case step 2 walked through.

Forward and drop act on the marked rows if any are set, else the cursor row, so `t` to mark a run and one `f` releases them together. The operator decides each one; nothing is auto-applied.

**Checkpoint.** You have forwarded one request untouched and dropped another, and History records both, the drop as a cancelled flow.

## 4. Make an edit permanent with Match & Replace

Holding every request to make the *same* edit by hand gets old fast. A standing edit belongs in the **Rewriter** tab (the Match & Replace editor, right of Comparer on the tab bar, or `Ctrl-P` → **Match & Replace**). Add a rule with an operation (**Replace** text in the head or body, **Add** / **Set** / **Remove** a header, or **Short circuit** to answer the request from the rule without dialing the origin at all) and scope it to a host glob so it fires only for matching traffic:

```bash
gori run rewriter add --op set_header --target request \
  --find X-Forwarded-For --value 127.0.0.1 --host '*.example.com'
```

Choose where the rule lives: **project** rules sit in this engagement's database, **global** rules go in `settings.json` and apply in every project. Set it in the editor's `scope:` row, or `--scope=global` headless. The rule takes effect the moment you save, with no restart, so turn intercept **off** and the edit now happens on its own, on every matching request.

**Checkpoint.** With intercept off, matching traffic carries your change automatically, and the editor's live preview shows how many recent flows the rule would touch.
