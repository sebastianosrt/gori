A JWT is only as trustworthy as the server's check of its signature. This playbook takes a token off a captured request, reads its claims, changes one, re-signs it, and fires the classic verification-bypass payloads (alg:none, a weak-secret guess, header injection) to find out which the server accepts. Budget about ten minutes.

> **Before you begin.** Set up a project and scope for a host you're authorized to test ([Set up an engagement](/playbooks/set-up-an-engagement/)), and capture a flow that carries a JWT; an `Authorization: Bearer eyJ…` header is the usual source. The examples target `api.example.com`.

## 1. Send a token to the JWT tab

The **JWT** tab is off the bar by default — press **`0`** and type "jwt", or `Ctrl-P` → **Go to JWT**; give it one of the nine slots in Preferences if you live in tokens. Find the token: open the captured flow in **History**, select the token text after `Bearer ` in the request detail, and `Space` `S` (**Send selection to…**) → `j` **JWT**. That seeds a new JWT sub-tab and decodes the token live into its **header**, **payload**, and **signature** on the Decode lens.

The decode shows what the token *claims*; it never checks the signature, so a token that decodes cleanly is not necessarily one the server trusts. That is the question the rest of this playbook answers.

**Checkpoint.** The JWT tab shows the token's header and payload as JSON, with the signature below.

## 2. Tamper a claim

Switch to the Encode lens with `Ctrl-T`, or `Space` → **Load decoded claims** to load the decoded token straight into the Encode editors. Edit the **PAYLOAD** JSON: escalate a `role`, swap a `sub`, extend an `exp`. Pick the algorithm with `Ctrl-A` (it cycles the HMAC family, then `RS`/`PS`/`ES` at 256/384/512, `EdDSA`, and `none`), set a **SECRET** when you're signing with an HMAC algorithm — or, for an asymmetric one, point the **KEY** card at a PEM private key — and the re-signed token appears live in OUTPUT. Copy it with `y`.

The same claim edit runs headless, taking the token from the argument or stdin. `--set KEY=VALUE` patches one claim (repeatable), or `--payload` replaces the claims wholesale:

```bash
gori run jwt eyJhbGci... --encode --set role=admin --secret s3cret       # escalate one claim
gori run jwt eyJhbGci... --encode --payload '{"sub":"1","admin":true}' --secret s3cret
```

`--set`'s value is JSON when it parses, so `admin=true` is a boolean and `role=admin` a string. Over MCP, `jwt_encode` takes the same `set` / `payload` edits.

If the token is `ES256` / `RS256` / `EdDSA` and you hold the signing key, `--key` takes it (inline PEM or a path), and `--verify` answers the question the decode cannot:

```bash
gori run jwt eyJhbGci... --encode --alg ES256 --key ./private.pem --set role=admin
gori run jwt eyJhbGci... --verify --key ./public.pem                # verified: yes | no (exit 0 | 1)
```

**Checkpoint.** OUTPUT holds a token carrying your edited claim, re-signed with the algorithm and secret you chose.

## 3. Run the attack presets

You rarely know the secret, so let gori generate the bypass attempts instead. On the Decode lens, below the decoded parts, is a selectable list of **attack payloads** built from the token:

| Attack | What it tests |
|--------|---------------|
| **alg:none** | Strips the signature and sets `alg` to `none` (plus `None` / `NONE` case variants). Catches a server that accepts unsigned tokens. |
| **Weak secret** | Re-signs with a list of common weak HMAC secrets. Catches a guessable signing key. |
| **Header injection** | Manipulates the `kid`, `jku`, `x5u`, and `jwk` header parameters. Catches a server that trusts attacker-supplied key material. |
| **Algorithm confusion** | Needs the server's public key. Downgrades an `RS`/`PS`/`ES` token to `HS256`, HMAC-keyed with the public key's own bytes. Catches a server that dispatches on the token's `alg` and reuses its verification key. |

Generate the same set headless:

```bash
gori run jwt eyJhbGci... --attacks
gori run jwt eyJhbGci... --attacks --key ./server-public.pem   # ...plus algorithm confusion
```

The public key is whatever the target publishes — a JWKS `x5c` certificate works as well as a bare `PUBLIC KEY` block, and gori reduces either to the SPKI PEM a server would hold.

Over MCP the `jwt_attacks` tool returns the identical list, taking the same key as `public_key` (and `jwt_decode` / `jwt_verify` / `jwt_encode` cover steps 1 and 2). All of them are read tools available even under `--read-only`: they touch no network and write nothing, though a `key` / `public_key` given as a path is read from disk.

An **encrypted** token — five segments rather than three — is a JWE, and none of this applies to it: gori shows its protected header (`alg`, `enc`, `kid`) so you know what you are looking at, and generates no payloads, because there is no claims segment to tamper with and no signature to strip.

**Checkpoint.** The ATTACKS list is populated with ready-to-send token variants.

## 4. Replay and confirm

A forged token proves nothing until the server sees it. Pick a payload (your tampered token from step 2, or a preset from step 3), copy it with `y`, paste it into the `Authorization` header of the captured request in **Repeater**, and re-send with `Ctrl-R`. Read the status against what the endpoint should return for a bad token:

- A `401` or `403` means the server rejected the forgery; it verified the signature.
- A `200` where you expected a reject means it did *not* verify; the token was accepted on your terms.

**Checkpoint.** You can tell an accepted forgery (a success status) from a rejected one (`401` / `403`), and you know which presets, if any, the server let through.
