A capture is a flat log; an attack surface is a shape. This playbook folds your captured History into a deduplicated `host → path` tree, collapses the id noise that hides the shape, then runs Discover to pull in the endpoints no click ever reached. It takes about ten minutes, most of it Discover working in the background.

> **Before you begin.** Finish [Set up an engagement](/playbooks/set-up-an-engagement/) so a project and its scope are in place, and browse the target enough that **History** has rows to fold. Step 3 sends real, unsolicited traffic, so run it only against a host you are authorized to test. The examples use `api.example.com` as a stand-in.

## 1. Browse to seed the map

Leave capture on (`c` toggles it) and click through the app the way a user would: log in, load the main views, submit a form. Then open **Target → Sitemap**. It collapses every flow in History into a deduplicated `host → path` tree, with a method chip on each endpoint and scope markers down the side, so a few hundred rows read as a dozen paths.

```bash
gori run sitemap
```

The tree is a view over the capture, not a second copy; anything you browse next appears the moment it lands. `--in-scope` limits it to in-scope hosts, matching the scope lens.

</figure>

**Checkpoint.** Your target host expands into a tree of paths, each carrying its method chip.

## 2. Fold noisy ids

A REST API buries its shape under identifiers: `/user/1`, `/user/2`, `/order/9f3c…` are one endpoint wearing a hundred faces. Press `g` to fold path-param ids, so `/user/1` and `/user/2` share one node and a long id collapses into a single `{uuid}`. What was a wall of near-identical rows becomes the handful of real endpoints behind them.

```bash
gori run sitemap            # folds ids by default; --no-group shows every one
                            # /search?q=1 + /search?q=2 fold onto /search; --no-fold-query splits them
```

**Checkpoint.** Numeric and uuid-shaped segments collapse to one node each, and the tree shrinks to distinct endpoints.

## 3. Find what you never clicked with Discover

The Sitemap only knows what you browsed. **Discover** finds the rest: it spiders links you never clicked, reads what the target says about itself (`robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, the `.well-known/` registry) and the paths quoted in its JavaScript, then brute-forces unlinked directories (`/admin`, `.git/config`, `/api/v2`). Open **Target → Discover**, or from a **Sitemap** node or a **History** flow press `Space` and pick **Discover here** to confine the run to that subtree. The popup chooses the exploration style (spider, brute-force, or both), a max depth, the crawl scope, and concurrency; the run happens in the background, and `^X` stops or `p` pauses it from the Discover sub-tab.

```bash
gori run discover --target https://api.example.com \
  --max-depth 3 \
  --extensions php,json,bak \
  --format jsonl
```

> Discover sends real, unsolicited traffic to the target: an actual request for every path it guesses. Run it only against systems you are authorized to test. It stays inside your project scope, and the sandbox and exclude rules are always respected.

**Checkpoint.** New paths appear in the Sitemap that you never browsed, and the run summary reports what it found and what its calibrator suppressed.

## 4. Read and act on the surface

A Discover finding is more than a URL. gori stores the request it framed and the response the origin sent, so the tree is evidence you can read. Select a discovered node and press `Enter` to open that exchange in the same detail view History uses: headers, body, pretty-printed JSON. From there `^R` sends it to the **Repeater** to start poking at it by hand.

As you triage, mark the paths that matter with `t` (a run of `t` marks consecutive rows), and use the `Space` menu to tag them or add the host to scope from right here, so the endpoints you care about survive the next capture. Nothing sends traffic on its own; you decide what to open and what to chase.

**Checkpoint.** You can open a discovered endpoint, read its real response, and send it onward to the Repeater.
