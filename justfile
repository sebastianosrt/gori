#
# BuildKit is pinned because the ignore list lives at
# `packaging/docker/Dockerfile.dockerignore`: only BuildKit reads a Dockerfile-adjacent
# one. The classic builder looks for `.dockerignore` in the context root, finds
# none, and ships `bin/`, `lib/` and `.git/` into the build context instead.

# Apple's `container` (macOS 26+, Apple Silicon) reads the same Dockerfile and takes
# the same flags as the two recipes above, so these mirror them rather than reshaping
# anything: `-v gori:/data` auto-creates the named volume, and `-it` gives the TUI its
# terminal. Its ignore-file rule is the STRICTER half of the note above — it looks for
# `packaging/docker/Dockerfile.dockerignore` and nothing else, never falling back to a
# context-root `.dockerignore` the way BuildKit does.
#
# Two more differences worth knowing. The builder runs in its own VM, which does not
# inherit the host's HTTP_PROXY and defaults to 2 CPUs / 2048 MB, where a `--release`
# build of gori runs well over an hour — `container builder stop && container builder
# start --cpus 8 --memory 8g` before the first one is worth the detour. And every container gets its own vmnet IP, so publishing a
# port is optional — `container ls` prints the address to point a client at instead.
