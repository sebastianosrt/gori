# Contributing to gori

Thanks for helping improve gori. This is a security tool for **authorized** testing
only — please keep contributions aligned with that purpose.

## Reporting bugs and ideas

Open an [issue](https://github.com/hahwul/gori/issues) — a bug report is most useful with
the gori version (`gori --version`), your OS, and the steps that reproduce it. For a
feature, say what you were trying to do, not only what to build. Small fixes are welcome
as a PR without an issue first; for anything that adds a subsystem or changes behaviour,
open an issue so the design can be settled before you write it.

## Getting set up

Requires [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org) `>= 1.21.0` and the native libraries used
for HTTP body decode:

- macOS: `brew install crystal brotli zstd sqlite`
- Debian/Ubuntu: `apt install crystal libbrotli-dev libzstd-dev libsqlite3-dev`
- Nix: `nix develop` sets all of it up, pinned to the compiler CI builds with

Then:

```sh
shards install   # fetch dependencies (incl. ameba, into lib/)
just build       # → bin/gori
just test        # run the spec suite
```

`just --list` shows every task. Build without the native codecs (gzip/deflate still
work via stdlib) with `crystal build -Dwithout_native_codecs`.

## Before you open a PR

- **`just check`** must pass — `crystal tool format --check` and ameba. Format only the
  files you changed (`crystal tool format <files>`); never run a whole-tree format (it
  reformats dozens of unrelated files due to Crystal version drift).
- **`just test`** must be green. Add or update specs under `spec/` mirroring the source
  you touched; `just test-<area>` runs a single subdir while iterating.
- Never build or benchmark with `-Dpreview_mt` — gori assumes the single-threaded fiber
  scheduler.
- If you change `shard.lock`, regenerate the Nix dependency set in the same commit:
  `just nix-shards` runs `crystal2nix` and puts the result at `packaging/nix/shards.nix`,
  and `just nix-shards-check` (which CI also runs) confirms the two agree — forget the
  regeneration and the flake goes on building the old revisions without complaining.
  `just vu` keeps `flake.nix`'s version in step with `shard.yml`.
- Keep changes scoped and behavior-preserving unless the PR is explicitly a behavior
  change; note any intentional behavior change in the PR description.
- Add a `CHANGELOG.md` line under `## Unreleased` for anything a user would notice, in
  the shape the released sections use: **one line per theme, plain, with the issue or PR
  numbers in parentheses at the end**. Join an existing theme line rather than adding a
  fourth bullet about the same area.

  The reasoning that justifies the change does not belong there. It belongs in the PR
  body — which the issue number already points at — or, when it settles a design
  question, in [DESIGN.md §7](DESIGN.md). A changelog entry that has to be read twice is
  one nobody can lift into release notes (#709).

## Sending the pull request

1. Fork it (<https://github.com/hahwul/gori/fork>)
2. Create your branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Open a pull request against `main`, describing what changed and why

One PR per concern. A review that has to separate an unrelated rename from the fix it
travels with is a slower review, and a revert takes the innocent half with it.

## Where things live

`src/gori/` is organized by subsystem: `proxy/` (the MITM proxy), `store.cr` + `store/`
(SQLite persistence), `tui/` (terminal UI), `verb.cr` + `verbs/` (the command system),
`mcp/` (MCP server), `cli/` (the `gori run` suite), and one directory per tool
(`repeater`, `fuzz`, `miner`, `sequencer`, `discover`, `oast`, `probe`, `decoder`).
Specs under `spec/` mirror the source tree: `spec/<dir>/<name>_spec.cr` covers
`src/gori/<dir>/<name>.cr`. The root of `spec/` holds two kinds of file and nothing else —
the spec for a top-level source file (`spec/scope_spec.cr` ↔ `src/gori/scope.cr`), and a
cross-cutting *seam* spec that asserts a property of several subsystems at once and so
mirrors no single file (`layering_spec.cr`, `send_seam_provenance_spec.cr`).

[DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) covers the *why*: the P0 to P8 principles that source comments
cite inline (`(P4)`, `(P6/P7)`), the layering contract those directories have to honour,
and the Scope / QL / rendering / data-model sections that comments cite as `DESIGN.md §N`.
Read it before adding a subsystem, and if your change makes a section wrong, fix the
section in the same PR.
