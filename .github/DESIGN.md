# DESIGN.md: gori architecture and principles

gori's source comments cite this file two ways: by principle (`(P4)`, `(P6/P7)`) and by
section (`DESIGN.md §4`). Both are load-bearing shorthand: roughly 120 principle citations
across 49 files, so the numbering here is stable. Sections keep their numbers and
principles keep their labels even when the prose around them is rewritten.

Anchor convention: every section carries an explicit `<a id="sN">` and every principle an
`<a id="pN">`, so `DESIGN.md#s4` and `DESIGN.md#p7` keep resolving no matter how a heading
is later reworded.

This document describes what the code does today, reconstructed from the code and its
comments. Where a principle and the code disagree, one of the two is a bug: record which
in [§7](#s7) rather than quietly widening the principle to fit.

<a id="s1"></a>

## §1 Principles (P0 to P8)

Each principle is one rule plus where to go read it in the tree.

<a id="p0"></a>

### P0: Minimal

Do not build a hierarchy or an abstraction speculatively; add structure when a concrete
second caller forces it, not before.

`src/gori.cr` defines a single `Gori::Error` base and subtypes only when a `rescue` has to
discriminate. `src/gori/tui/screen.cr` keeps `Screen` to the primitives gori's own chrome
needs, "minimal, grow-as-needed widgets" ([§5](#s5)).

<a id="p1"></a>

### P1: One execution path

A feature is declared once and gets no private dispatch path.

A `Verb::Definition` (`src/gori/verb.cr`) is the one source of truth for a keybinding, a
command-palette entry, and a space-menu entry; all three run the same `#call`. Bindings are
declared only in `src/gori/verb/keymap.cr`, and `src/gori/tui/palette.cr` and
`src/gori/tui/space_menu.cr` both go through the registry rather than re-implementing the
action.

Reach: P1 holds inside the TUI. The `gori run` CLI and the `gori mcp` server do not read the
verb registry; they reach feature parity by calling the same engines ([§2](#s2)), which is a
convention rather than a shared code path. That gap is real, known, and under decision in
issue #357.

<a id="p2"></a>

### P2: not assigned

There is no P2. The label has never been used in the tree, and `CSP2` in
`src/gori/probe/passive/security_headers.cr` is a Content-Security-Policy version, not a
principle. It is left vacant rather than closed up; see [Numbering](#numbering).

<a id="p3"></a>

### P3: No premature generalization of data

Model what the traffic actually contains. Collapsing it into templates is an explicit,
reversible view choice, never a parse-time assumption.

`src/gori/sitemap.cr` gives every distinct URL segment its own node, and only then folds
numeric runs and opaque ids into `{uuid}` / `{hex}` / `{date}` group nodes, above an explicit
threshold, keeping the real children underneath. Folding happens when the tree is built;
the stored rows keep the URL exactly as captured.

<a id="p4"></a>

### P4: The human decides

Holding, editing, dropping, rewriting, and active probing are operator decisions, made
explicitly and auditably, never inferred or auto-applied behind the operator's back.

`src/gori/interceptor.cr` and `src/gori/tui/runner.cr` hold an in-flight message
*indefinitely* for a forward / edit / drop decision; the only timeout is an opt-in guard for
an attached agent, and with no agent ever attached the hold stays indefinite.
`src/gori/rules.cr` (match&replace) is human-configured and persisted per project. Scope,
sandbox, and the active-scan gates are all explicit ([§3](#s3)).

<a id="p5"></a>

### P5: Mediated state

Mutable state is reached only through a narrow facade; nothing reaches across into another
component's raw state.

Verbs get `Verb::ExecContext` (`src/gori/verb/context.cr`) and never touch TUI, proxy, or
store state directly. Tab controllers get `Host` (`src/gori/tui/tab_controller.cr`) and never
call another controller or `Runner`. The Store writer fiber fires replies and events only
*after* commit, so nothing observes uncommitted rows (`src/gori/store.cr`). Project state is
isolated per project DB (`src/gori/project.cr`).

<a id="p6"></a>

### P6: Never stall the data path

The proxy and the Store writer are hot paths; persistence and analysis happen off the
critical path.

`src/gori/store.cr` batches a burst of writes into one transaction to amortize fsync.
`src/gori/proxy/server.cr` and `src/gori/proxy/upstream.cr` set `sync = true` so writes go out
immediately. `src/gori/proxy/head_rewriter.cr` rewrites the head while the body streams
untouched, and body rewrites are opt-in precisely because they cost the zero-buffer path
(`src/gori/proxy/codec/body.cr` streams with `max_bytes` at `Int64::MAX` when forwarding).

<a id="p7"></a>

### P7: Raw bytes are the truth

The captured wire bytes are canonical. Pretty views, decodes, and highlights are derived and
display-only, and a message the codec cannot fully parse still yields its octets.

`src/gori/proxy/codec/http1.cr` never rejects malformed input on capture or replay, only on
the live MITM path where forwarding it would be ambiguous. `src/gori/pretty.cr` never mutates
the input slice. `src/gori/store/models.cr` stores head and body as byte-exact wire octets,
with the parsed columns as a queryable projection. The h2 raw frame log and the WS raw frames
stay the truth even when the assembled view is incomplete.

<a id="p8"></a>

### P8: Pull, not push

There is no queue, inbox, or ranking. You *find* things with a query, and per-row signals are
computed only when a row is on screen.

`src/gori/tui/history_view.cr` is a flat append-only log with a QL bar (`/`) as the only
navigation. `src/gori/store/reads.cr` fetches a flow's passive-signal tags lazily, per
on-screen row. `src/gori/ql.cr` is the analysis surface ([§4](#s4)).

<a id="numbering"></a>

### Numbering

The set is deliberately not contiguous. P2 stays vacant.

Renumbering was considered and rejected: the labels carry roughly 120 citations across 49
source files, so closing the hole would invalidate every citation for a cosmetic gain, and
any comment missed in that commit would silently start asserting a different principle. A
future principle should take P9 rather than fill P2.

P0, P1, P4, P5, P6, P7, and P8 are cited inline in `src/`. P3 is cited once, in
`src/gori/sitemap.cr`.

## §2 Architecture and data flow

```
client ──▶ Proxy (proxy/) ──▶ target
             │  scope + sandbox gate, intercept (P4), match&replace, host overrides
             ▼
          Store (store.cr)          single writer fiber + Channel (P6)
             │  flows / ws messages / h2 frames / sse events / issues / notes / sessions
             ▼
   ┌─────────┴───────────┬─────────────────────┐
  TUI (tui/)          CLI (cli/run.cr)      MCP (mcp/tools.cr)
  verbs + tabs        `gori run ...`        agent tools
```

Three surfaces, one engine layer. The TUI, the `gori run` CLI, and the `gori mcp` server all
build on the same lower-level engines (`Repeater::*`, `Fuzz`, `Miner`, `Sequencer`,
`Discover`, `Probe`, `QL`, `Store`). They do **not** share a dispatcher. Surface parity
("every action is also a CLI subcommand and an MCP tool") is a convention, held by each
surface calling the shared engines rather than by one code path. Keeping the surfaces thin
over fat shared engines is what makes that convention cheap to hold, and every parity gap
found so far has been in the surface layer, not the engines.

Concurrency: gori runs on Crystal's cooperative fiber scheduler, never `-Dpreview_mt`.
`Store` funnels all writes through one fiber fed by a buffered `Channel`; reads use the WAL
connection pool directly. `Scope`, `Rules`, `HostOverrides`, and `Interceptor` each guard an
in-memory snapshot with a `Mutex`, and `Rules` and `Interceptor` additionally keep a lock-free
`Atomic` counter so the common no-op case on the proxy hot path takes no lock at all.
Cross-*process* coordination (a second `gori mcp` process driving intercept decisions, or
capture ownership of a project) goes through the flock-based `CaptureLock`/`OpenLock` and
Store bridge tables, not shared memory. Live in-memory objects on the proxy path
(`Rules`, `Bindings`, `Probe::Analyzer` mode, `Scope`, `HostOverrides`) are re-read from
the store — and the global rewriter/colormarker sections from settings.json — on the
capturer's `data_version` tick / headless reload loop. An exclusive `OpenLock` (Compact,
project delete) makes a peer `Store.open` fail rather than proceed unannounced.

<a id="s2-1"></a>

### §2.1 Layering contract

Core subsystems do not know that a surface exists. `store/`, `proxy/`, `probe/`, `fuzz/`,
`miner/`, `discover/`, `sequencer/`, and `oast/` must not reference `Tui::`, `CLI::`, or
`MCP::` in code. Enforced by `spec/layering_spec.cr`; the same set is checkable by hand:

```sh
grep -rnE '\b(Tui|CLI|MCP)::' \
  src/gori/{store,proxy,probe,fuzz,miner,discover,sequencer,oast,authorize}/ \
  src/gori/{store,probe,fuzz,miner,discover,sequencer,oast,authorize}.cr
```

(There is no `src/gori/proxy.cr`; the proxy is directory-only.) A comment may point at a
caller; code may not — so the assertion is that **every hit is a comment line**, not that
there are N of them. The count is not the check precisely because it moves whenever one of
those comments is reworded: this paragraph claimed "exactly one hit" for long enough that
the true figure reached twelve across four files, which is the failure mode the spec exists
to remove.

Dependencies run one way. Surfaces depend on engines, engines depend on `Store` and the
codecs, and nothing depends on a surface. `src/gori/sitemap.cr` and `src/gori/notes.cr` are
the pattern to copy: the data model and the pure algorithms live in a surface-free module,
and `Tui::SitemapView` and `gori run sitemap` are thin layers over it, which is why the CLI
report and the interactive tab cannot drift apart.

One caveat worth naming: the CLI reaches into `MCP::Serialize` for JSON output
(`src/gori/cli/run/intercept.cr`, `src/gori/cli/run/history.cr`). That is surface to surface,
not core to surface, so it does not breach the rule above, but the shared JSON shape should
move to a neutral module the day a third caller needs it (P0: when the second caller forces
it, and it now has).

<a id="s3"></a>

## §3 Scope

Cited from `src/gori/scope.cr`.

Scope is an ordered include/exclude rule set evaluated over `scheme://host/target`. A rule has
a kind (include or exclude) and a match type: `host` (exact, subdomain, or `*` glob,
case-insensitive), `string` (case-insensitive substring), or `regex` (case-sensitive).

It has three distinct jobs, and conflating them is the usual source of bugs:

1. **Display lens.** Everything is captured regardless. When scope is enabled, History,
   Sitemap, and the Comparer flow picker show only in-scope flows; History and Sitemap retain
   their inline scope markers.
2. **Intercept gate.** Out-of-scope flows are not held for a decision.
3. **Sandbox: a hard containment gate.** When on, a request to a host that is not allowlisted
   is blocked outright and still recorded, so the operator sees the blocked attempt (P4/P7).
   A scope with no include rules blocks everything rather than allowing everything: the gate
   fails closed, on purpose, and `Probe::Active` shares that same decision.

Rules live in the Store and are mirrored into an in-memory `Scope` snapshot read on the proxy
hot path; SQL-side and in-memory evaluation are deliberately kept in parity so a query and the
live gate can never disagree.

Active traffic (repeater, fuzz, mine, sequence, discover, active probe) is gated on the same
rule set, through one chokepoint: `Gori::Outbound` (`src/gori/outbound.cr`). The active senders
`Fuzz::Sender` and `Repeater::Sender` take it as a **constructor argument**, so an ungated
sender does not compile (P5). It carries two layers:

- **Layer 1**, up front and once: the include/allowlist decision. Its strictness is the only
  thing that legitimately varies per surface, and the variants are named rather than
  re-derived at each call site: `Outbound.agent` (MCP, refusing anything not included,
  including an unconfigured project), `Outbound.cli` (`gori run`, where an unconfigured
  project stays permissive), `Outbound.interactive` (TUI, no up-front gate because the
  operator typed the target).
- **Layer 2**, per send: Sandbox mode always, plus explicit EXCLUDE rules for an automated
  sweep. Identical on every surface, and applied even when Layer 1 was waived.

Both layers judge the URL anchored on the host actually being **dialled**, not the one in the
request line (`Outbound.scope_url`). A raw request may deliberately carry an absolute-form
request line pointing somewhere else, which is a legitimate Host-header, cache-poisoning, or
SSRF test and still goes out verbatim (P7); scoping on that spoofed host would let an anchored
include rule authorise a send to a different origin.

Waiving Layer 1 is only reachable through `--allow-unscoped` / `allow_unscoped:true`, or a
genuinely absent project. Either way the result is a named `Unscoped(reason)` that shows up in
the audit line, never a nil that silently skips the gate.

## §4 Query language (QL)

Cited from `src/gori/ql.cr`.

QL is a Lucene/KQL-style boolean filter over captured flows: bare terms for free text,
`field:value` predicates, `~`-prefixed regex, and `AND` / `OR` / `NOT` / grouping.

- `:` fields: `host` `path` `method` `scheme` `proto` `status` `size` `reqsize` `respsize`
  `dur` `header` `body`
- `~` regex on: `host` `path` `url` `header` `body`
- comparison ops (`<=` `>=` `<` `>` `=`) apply to `status`, `size`, `reqsize`, `respsize`,
  `dur`

It compiles to a SQL `WHERE` fragment plus bound params. Values are always parameterised,
never interpolated, so the projection columns stay injection-safe. Regex terms are evaluated
by the `Gori::SafeRegexp` function that `Store` installs into the connection
(`SafeRegexp.install`, `src/gori/store.cr`), so an invalid pattern or a byte-unsafe body
fails closed rather than crashing the scan.

QL is the only way you navigate History, because there is no queue and no ranking (P8). One
grammar backs all of it: the History `/` filter bar, `gori run history`, the MCP
`list_history` and `ql_*` tools, and the other filter surfaces built on `filter_ast.cr`.

<a id="s5"></a>

## §5 Rendering and chrome

Cited from `src/gori/tui/screen.cr`.

The TUI builds gori's chrome (tab bar, panes, overlays) and its views, nothing more: P0
applied to widgets, "minimal, grow-as-needed widgets" rather than a general toolkit. `Screen`
is an immediate-mode drawing surface with bounds-checked writes; the backend keeps its own
front/back cell grid and, on flush, forwards only the cells that changed since the previous
frame. Measured cost lives in `set_cell`, not in highlighting, which is why `Screen` interns
single-cell strings.

Rendering is a pure function of state. Views hold ephemeral display and edit state and expose
`render(screen, rect, focused)`; controllers interpret input and own persistence through
`Host` (P5). Overlays are modal cards centred over the body. Theming is a `Palette` record,
with built-in and user themes switched at runtime.

Width is measured, never assumed: `Screen.draw_width` reports the cells a string will
occupy, and views that draw per grapheme cluster sum the width per cluster so a wide
character is never half-drawn.

<a id="s6"></a>

## §6 Data model

The Store's domain types live in `src/gori/store/models.cr`; the schema and its ordered
migrations in `src/gori/store/schema.cr`.

- **Flow**: one captured request/response exchange, plus WS messages, h2 frames, and SSE
  events for streaming protocols. Raw request and response bytes are stored verbatim (P7);
  the FTS text is derived for search. Targets are stored ABSOLUTE-form, which is the wire
  truth.
- **Sitemap node**: one node per distinct URL segment (P3), with operator path tags.
- **Issue**: the final output, a human-confirmed finding, triaged, optionally linked to the
  flow, note, or session that evidences it.
- **Note**: the running scratchpad and report.
- **Sessions**: persisted Repeater / Fuzzer / Miner / Sequencer / OAST workbench state.

Directories are `0700` (`Paths::DIR_MODE`) and the DB, plus its `-wal` and `-shm`
sidecars, are `0600` (`Store.harden_permissions`).

## §7 Decision log

Design decisions that refine a principle, newest last. Append here instead of editing a
principle's wording, so that the label a source comment cites keeps meaning what it meant when
the comment was written.

Format: one `### YYYY-MM-DD: title` block per decision, naming the principle it refines and
the issue or PR that settled it. Adding an entry must not require restructuring anything
above it.

### 2026-08-21: a peer's write must reach the live proxy objects, or fail honestly

Refines: [P1](#p1), [P6](#p6). TUI + MCP coexistence audit.

Three surfaces share one project DB. The gap was not the WAL writer (that queues) but
in-memory objects the capturing process built at open and never re-read: Match&Replace,
extract rules, and probe mode sat on the proxy hot path while MCP `create_rule` /
`set_probe_mode` reported success against the store. The tick (`Runner#apply_external_change`,
headless `App#spawn_reload_loop`) now reloads those objects. Probe mode is adopted from the
persisted row without writing it back, so the tick cannot race a peer's `off` back to
`active`.

Global rewriter/colormarker live in settings.json. The existing 3-way merge is section-granular
and correct for unrelated keys; those two sections hold a list plus its id allocator, so a
wholesale section win minted colliding ids and dropped the peer's rules. They now merge by
rule id, and CRUD re-reads only that section before allocating.

`OpenLock.try_shared` used to give up in ~20 ms and open unannounced. Compact holds the
matching exclusive lock for a second or more, after which a later delete cannot see the
store. `Store.open` now retries on the order of Compact and then fails; unwritable mounts
still proceed. `busy_timeout` still blocks the whole scheduler (SQLite's handler never
returns to Crystal); the comments that said it parked one fiber were wrong, the 5000 ms
value is unchanged.

A `body:` query that cannot drain FTS because a peer holds the writer answers retryable
`FTS_BACKLOG` rather than a short match set. `send_request` classifies a rolled-back
`insert_flow` as `PROJECT_BUSY`, not `INVALID_ARGUMENT`.

A guard against a peer is an INTERRUPTION, not a veto. Every refusal added here is one the
operator can answer: the Issues lost-update guard arms a second `esc` (against the version it
showed, so a further peer write refuses again) and names the conflict in the exit prompts, which
are the last point either version can still be chosen. The refusals that are NOT the operator's
to answer — a `body:` query whose index could not drain — retry the contention first and only
report what survives it, because a guard that reports a collision the process could have waited
out is spending the operator's attention on its own scheduling.

The reload tick is on the render fiber, so its cost is a frame. Both settings folds are gated on
the file's bytes and both reloaded lists re-anchor their selection by id, for the same reason
`IssuesView#apply_filter` gives: a list that moves under a cursor re-aims the next keypress.

The single `ui_state` row goes to the capture holder, which is the tiebreak the intercept
bridge already uses — but the holder is not necessarily a window. A headless `gori run capture`
holds the lock and draws nothing, so a lock-ONLY gate published nothing at all while the
operator's view-only TUI was on screen and told the agent it "may not have run". A view-only
window therefore publishes when no UI-bearing holder is: no row, a row a view-only window
wrote, or a holder's row older than `UI_STATE_TAKEOVER`. Both windows write only when their
own view MOVES, so two idle windows never trade the row, and the holder's write is
unconditional — any activity there reclaims it. The row carries `holds_capture` so the reader
can weigh whose view it is.

### 2026-07-25: this document restored

Refines: none. Issue #353.

`DESIGN.md` was removed in `ae7674a` and never rewritten, leaving the P0 to P8 labels cited in
47 files with no definition anywhere. Restored from `ae7674a^` and re-verified against the
tree, with the numbering kept as it was ([Numbering](#numbering)) and the layering contract in
[§2.1](#s2-1) written as a runnable check rather than a claim.

### 2026-07-25: one reload semantic for the active-traffic scope gate

Refines: [P5](#p5). Issue #354.

The scope gate on active traffic was enforced at roughly twenty call sites across three
surfaces, and the three disagreed on when a running job re-read the rules. MCP re-read them on
a throttled interval; `gori run` snapshotted at start-up and closed the store, so it could not
re-read at all; the TUI re-read only as a side effect of its own `data_version` poll. The
practical result was that a mid-run EXCLUDE or Sandbox toggle stopped an MCP sweep, was
invisible to a CLI sweep, and stopped a TUI sweep by accident rather than by design.

`Gori::Outbound` now owns the reload: before each Layer-2 check it re-reads the scope from its
store, throttled to `Outbound::RELOAD_INTERVAL` (1s). A per-send DB read is too heavy at high
concurrency, and the clock is advanced *before* the blocking reload so concurrent worker fibers
cannot stampede the store. A failed reload is swallowed and the last-known rules stay in force,
degrading to the old snapshot behaviour rather than to allow-everything.

What that buys is uniform for every LONG-RUNNING job (fuzz, mine, sequence, minimize, active
probe) on all three surfaces, which is where the divergence actually mattered. A one-shot
Repeater send builds a fresh decision per send, so the throttle window never elapses within it
and no reload fires; it reads whatever rules its scope already holds, which for the TUI is the
live session scope the `data_version` poll keeps current.

MCP's semantic won because it is the only one that honours a policy change the operator makes
*while* a sweep is running, which is exactly when they most need it to stop. Adopting it on the
CLI meant the read connection now lives as long as the run (`Outbound#close` releases it)
rather than being closed immediately after the snapshot.

The gate is Store-mediated rather than pushed: nothing notifies a running job of a rule change,
the job pulls the current rules on its own schedule ([P8](#p8)). One consequence is worth
stating, because it is a deliberate tradeoff and not an oversight: a rule written at T is
honoured somewhere in `[T, T + RELOAD_INTERVAL]`, not at T, and sends inside that window use
the previous decision. Making it exact would need a per-send read on the hot path, which
[P6](#p6) rules out.

### 2026-07-25: run assembly belongs to the tool, option parsing to the surface

Refines: [P1](#p1). Issue #356 (fuzz, the reference implementation).

Every multi-surface tool re-implemented its "assemble a run" pipeline once per surface. For the
fuzzer, *template parse → auto-mark → payload sets → matcher → config → generator → sender →
engine* existed three times over (TUI `build_engine`, `gori run fuzz`, MCP `build_fuzz_job`),
and the copies had drifted on things a user can see: the TUI never applied the project's
hostname overrides to a fuzz send, and both `gori run fuzz` and MCP ran `Env.expand` over a
seeding flow's target *twice*, so a var whose value itself contained a `$TOKEN` resolved on
those two surfaces and not in the TUI.

`Fuzz::PlanOptions` (a plain struct) plus `Fuzz::Plan.build(options, outbound)` splits the two
jobs that were tangled: parsing an input format is surface-specific and stays put — an
`OptionParser` on the CLI, the args hash on MCP, view state in the TUI — while everything
downstream of the normalized options has exactly one implementation, and `Fuzz::Engine.new` has
exactly one call site. The same split is intended for `Miner`, `Sequencer`, `Discover` and
`Repeater`.

Three specifics worth recording, because they are choices rather than mechanics:

- **The `Outbound` is an argument, never built by the builder.** Layer-1 strictness differs per
  surface on purpose (`Outbound.agent` / `.cli` / `.interactive`, see the entry above).
  Constructing one inside `Plan.build` would collapse that distinction into whichever policy
  was hard-coded, which is exactly the kind of quiet unification this refactor must not do.
- **`Env.expand` runs once, on the raw template and on the resolved target.** Twice is not a
  no-op: expansion is a single pass, so a second pass resolves tokens that the first pass
  *produced*. Once is the behaviour a user can reason about.
- **The scope gate reads the template's BASELINE rendering, not its raw first line.** The TUI's
  template arrives already marked, so the raw line would have fed `/find?term=§VAL§` into the
  Layer-1 check there while feeding `/find?term=VAL` from the CLI and MCP — and a `§` in a path
  position defeats an anchored include rule. Rendering each position's own default back out is
  marker-free on all three.

A surface still owns its own error wording: `Fuzz::PlanError` carries a machine-readable
`reason`, and each surface renders the sentence naming its own flags (`--auto` / `auto:true` /
`^A params`). Sharing the assembly must not flatten three different vocabularies into one.

### 2026-07-26: the verb registry is a TUI concern, and `ExecContext` is a catalogue

Refines: [P1](#p1). Issue #357.

Two comments described a system that does not exist. `src/gori/verb.cr` promised that one
`Verb::Definition` drives "a keybinding AND a command-palette entry (and later an MCP tool +
CLI subcommand)", and `src/gori/verb/context.cr` called `ExecContext` "thin … deliberately
(P0)". Neither the later nor the thin was true: `grep -rn 'Verb::Registry\|Verb::Definition'
src/gori/cli src/gori/mcp` returns nothing, and the interface declares 266 abstract methods.
Both read as descriptions of the present, which cost reviewers time. The comments are now
corrected; the structure is deliberately unchanged.

Measured on `main` at `57f1812`:

- `ExecContext` requires **266** abstract methods: 42 in `verb/context.cr` and 224 more spread
  across the twenty per-tool files in `verb/context/`, which exist only to hold declarations.
- `Tui::Runner` (with its `runner/*.cr` mixins) defines **534** methods and implements all
  266, none missing. It is the only production implementor; `spec/support/fake_context.cr` is
  a recording double.
- Only the 42 root ones are app chrome and cross-tool actions. The other 224 are tool intents
  grouped by tool (repeater 28, issues 23, probe 22, history 17, fuzzer 17, jwt 13 …) —
  surface-neutral in name.

Collapsing `ExecContext` into direct `Runner` calls was considered and rejected. It would
delete the 266 declarations and the indirection, not the 266 implementations, which the
palette and keymap still have to invoke — a large mechanical edit for no behavioural gain. It
would also destroy the two things the interface does buy: one enumerable catalogue of every
action a verb can trigger, and a one-way dependency, since `verb/` names no `Tui::` in code
([§2.1](#s2-1)). Keeping a 266-method abstraction is not a [P0](#p0) minimalism claim, and it
should stop being written up as one.

Wiring CLI and MCP into the registry was also rejected, for a reason worth recording because
it is not obvious from the method names. Those 224 tool intents are surface-neutral in name
and TUI-coupled in semantics: `repeater_send` means "send the ACTIVE sub-tab",
`probe_rule_toggle` means "toggle the HIGHLIGHTED row". A CLI or MCP caller has no selection,
only an id. Making them callable from another surface therefore requires an argument schema
so an intent can name its target — the field `Verb::Definition` records as absent. That
schema is the prerequisite, not a follow-up to the wiring, and it is a project of its own
across ~224 intents.

So P1's reach stays where [P1](#p1) already describes it: one execution path inside the TUI,
parity elsewhere by calling the same engines. Read P1's closing sentence — "that gap is real,
known, and under decision in issue #357" — as settled by this entry: the gap is deliberate, and
what would close it is the argument schema, not registry wiring. If CLI/MCP parity work resumes
at the rate it ran before, revisit, but open the argument-schema issue first.

### 2026-07-26: Discover's seed waives Layer 1, never Layer 2

Refines: [P4](#p4). Issue #364, surfaced by the review of #354.

`Discover::Engine#seed_frontier` put the seed, `<origin>/robots.txt`, `<origin>/sitemap.xml` and
the origin-root soft-404 calibration straight onto the frontier with no `bounded_url` call.
Every URL the crawl derived afterwards was gated normally, which is why it read as a deliberate
seed exemption rather than a hole, but only the *path-confinement* half had ever been reasoned
about (well-known paths live at the origin, so a run confined to `/app/` has to step outside its
subtree to find them). The scope gate rode along with it by accident.

The exposure was not uniform across the four, and the difference is what settles the decision. A
Layer-1 `in_scope` verdict already implies a clean Layer 2, because `Scope#sandbox_blocks?` and
`Outbound#evaluate` both route through `allowlisted_unlocked?` — so for the **seed** the gap only
ever opened where Layer 1 was waived, which is the TUI and any `--allow-unscoped` run. The three
**derived** requests were exposed on every surface, since they are anchored on `Url.origin` and a
path-scoped include rule never covers them.

The two-layer split in [§3](#s3) already answers this, and the answer is asymmetric on purpose:

- **Layer 1 stays waived for all four.** The seed is what a human typed, which is the same
  argument `Outbound.interactive` makes for the TUI, and every surface has already made that
  decision before the engine runs (`Outbound.agent` refuses an out-of-scope seed, `.cli` refuses
  one on a configured project, `.interactive` waives by name; the CLI and MCP enforce the verdict
  right after `Plan.build`, before a single send). `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` inherit it:
  they are derived from a seed the operator was already authorised to hit and live at that same
  origin by construction. Re-asking the include question here would only re-ask what the surface
  just answered, and on a path-scoped include rule it would break the calibration on every run
  that has one.
- **Layer 2 now applies to all four.** Sandbox's documented promise in [§3](#s3), that a request
  to a host which is not allowlisted is blocked outright, carries no "unless the operator typed
  it" clause, and `Outbound.interactive`'s own contract already says Layer 2 still hard-stops the
  send. "The operator chose this target" was never an argument about Sandbox. Explicit EXCLUDE
  rules come with it (`sweep_block` semantics, not `send_block`): discover is the most automated
  sweep gori has, and its every other URL is judged by the same predicate.

Three specifics worth recording:

- **A blocked seed fails the run, loudly.** The verdict is taken in `Engine#initialize` and
  `Engine#start` emits it as the run's sole terminal `ErrorEvent` (`Engine::SEED_BLOCKED`); it is
  not a skipped enqueue. A blocked seed blocks everything derived from it, so the alternative is
  a run that finishes with zero findings and no reason, which an operator reads as "there is
  nothing there" rather than "gori sent nothing" ([P4](#p4)). A blocked `robots.txt`/`sitemap.xml`
  is skipped silently instead: the crawl is still meaningful without it.
- **A gated calibration still routes its two dependants.** `@seed_calibration_dir` is set whether
  or not the Calibrate task survives the gate. Without it a robots/sitemap outcome falls back to
  `record_page`, whose raw-status trust reports both as findings on a 200-everything server,
  which is the exact false positive the calibration exists to prevent. With it and no baseline
  they go uncounted: no baseline, no claim.
- **The gate is the engine's injected `ScopePolicy`, not an `Outbound`.** `StoreScope#allowed?`
  is already the negation of `sandbox_blocks? || excluded?`, which is `sweep_block`'s predicate,
  and the engine stays Store-free, which is the whole reason that seam exists.

What this does **not** close, deliberately, because each is a separate decision: brute-force and
calibration probes are still authorised by their *directory* rather than per URL, so a `string`
or `regex` EXCLUDE that matches a child but not its parent does not stop them; and
`Plan.resolve_policy` still hands an unconfigured scope an `OpenScope`, so Layer 2 is absent
entirely on a project with Sandbox on and no rules. Both are closed by the two entries below.

### 2026-07-26: a directory verdict does not authorise the URLs under it

Refines: [§3](#s3). Issue #391, the remaining half of the #364 review.

`enqueue_probes` was the only `@frontier <<` site with no gate: it built `Url.parse("#{bl.dir}#{cand}")`
and pushed a Probe straight onto the frontier, and `process_calibrate` sent `"#{dir}#{bogus_name}"`
`calibrate_probes + extensions.size` times the same way. With the defaults that is **~278 real
requests per calibrated directory on one `allowed?` answer about the directory**.

The reason a directory verdict cannot stand in for its children is that only some rule kinds are
monotone under a path append. `host` rules and `string` INCLUDEs are; `string` and `regex`
EXCLUDEs are not, and neither are the `regex` INCLUDEs Sandbox reads as its allowlist — any
`$`-anchored or length-bounded pattern matches a directory and refuses everything beneath it. So
an EXCLUDE on `logout` / `signout` / `shutdown`, the canonical "do not touch destructive
endpoints" rule, was silently ignored by the brute-forcer even though `logout` ships on line 41
of the built-in wordlist, alongside `admin`, `actuator/env`, `.git/config` and `.env`.

The path confine was escapable by the same append: `Url.parse` collapses dot-segments, so a
wordlist entry of `../admin` under an `/app/`-confined run re-parsed to `/admin`, and
`@confine_path` lived only inside `bounded_url`, which probes never reached.

The fix splits by layer rather than by call site, because the two layers have different contracts:

- **Layer 2 moves to `send_with_retries`,** the single funnel all three send sites pass through.
  Calibration probes are built by a *worker* at send time from a random bogus name, so no
  enqueue-time gate can see them at all; this is the only line that can judge them. Brute-force
  candidates are additionally gated in `enqueue_probes`, which keeps a refused one out of the
  frontier and out of `per_dir_cap` instead of spending both on a send that will be refused.
  A refusal returns a benign `Engine::SCOPE_REFUSED` Result in the shape `CappedBackend` already
  uses for the request cap, and is **not** counted as an error: it is a decision the operator
  asked for, not a failure of the run.
- **The path confine moves to `enqueue_probes` only,** via the `confined?` predicate now shared
  with `bounded_url`. It deliberately does *not* go on the send chokepoint: the origin-root
  calibration and the two well-known paths waive the confine on purpose (previous entry), and
  gating there would refuse them on every path-scoped run.
- **Layer 1 (`containment` / `boundary?`) is deliberately NOT re-asked per probe.** It was
  answered for the directory, which is what the crawl actually reached, and [§3](#s3) makes
  Layer 1 the layer whose strictness legitimately varies per surface. Re-asking it would also
  mean a narrow anchored include silently disables brute-force under a directory that include
  itself admitted. Layer 2 is the layer that is identical everywhere, and it is the one that now
  bites every send.

### 2026-07-26: a rule-less scope is not an absent one

Refines: [§3](#s3). Issue #392.

`Plan.resolve_policy` returned `OpenScope` for `scope.nil? || verdict.unscoped?`, and
`unscoped?` is true exactly when `Scope#configured?` is false — that is, whenever the project's
scope has no *rules*. `OpenScope#allowed?` is unconditionally true, so Layer 2 was absent for the
entire run.

Sandbox is enabled independently of rules (`Scope#enable_sandbox` takes none into account), and
with no include rules `sandbox_blocks?` blocks everything, which [§3](#s3) states is deliberate.
So on a project with Sandbox on and no rules the proxy blocked every request and every other
automated sweep refused — `Outbound#sweep_block` skips only on a **nil** scope, never on a
rule-less one — while `gori run discover` and the TUI Discover tab crawled and brute-forced
completely unrestricted. Discover was the sole fail-**open** tool, in the one configuration §3
singles out as fail-closed.

The fix separates the two questions the old condition conflated. `scope.nil?` — genuinely no
project — keeps `OpenScope`, because there is nothing to consult. A rule-less scope now gets
`StoreScope` like any other. This changes containment not at all: `StoreScope#configured?`
delegates to `Scope#configured?`, still false, so scope-aware containment keeps falling back to
same-origin and `boundary?` is never consulted. The only difference is that `allowed?` starts
consulting Sandbox and EXCLUDE, and on an ordinary rule-less project with Sandbox off both are
false — so those runs are byte-for-byte unaffected.

### 2026-07-26: a request line refuses what frames it and encodes what merely breaks it

Refines: [P7](#p7). Issue #394, the remaining half of the #390 review.

`Headers.safe_url?` rejected CR and LF only, but `Sender#build_get` writes
`GET #{target} HTTP/1.1\r\n` and **space is that line's field separator**. `Extract::ATTR`'s
`"([^"]*)"` captures a space, `Url.resolve` strips only the ends, and `URI.parse` keeps it
verbatim in `path` and `query` — so an ordinary `<a href="/my file.pdf">`, which is common in
handwritten HTML, put `GET /my file.pdf HTTP/1.1` on a real socket. No attacker required. A
lenient origin reads target `/my` and version `file.pdf`, so gori requests a resource it did
not record; a strict one 400s, and that 400 diverges from the soft-404 baseline, which
`Calibrate.hit?` scores at +0.50 — a false-POSITIVE source in the brute-forcer, not a cosmetic
defect. The malformed line then persisted into the stored flow head via `Discover::Persist`
(`Import::Builder::CONTROL_CHAR` is `[\x00-\x1f\x7f]`, which does not cover 0x20), so a
byte-exact Repeater re-send reproduced it.

The rule is not restated here. It is `Proxy::Codec::Http1.request_token_safe?` — no octet
`<= 0x20` or `0x7F` reaches a request line raw — which the #397 fix made the one home for
exactly this class, after gori hit it in three subsystems in a week. Discover adds only the
part that is its own: a **repair** for the half of the class that has one.

The remedy splits by what the octet does to the wire, not by which issue found it:

- **CR and LF frame.** They do not corrupt one request line, they end it and begin a second
  message (#390). No author writes one into an href. They are **refused** — dropped at every
  enqueue by `Headers.safe_url?`, refused at the wire by `Sender#fetch` — which keeps #390's
  disposition intact. Encoding them instead would convert a splice attempt into a real request
  for a URL nobody authored, and put `%0D%0A` rows in the operator's Sitemap.
- **SP, TAB, DEL and the remaining C0 separate fields.** They break one line and cannot start a
  second. A space in an href is a real resource a browser fetches, so refusing it would silently
  shrink a crawl's coverage — the failure mode this project treats as worse than an error
  ([P4](#p4)). They are **percent-encoded**, which is lossless and is what every browser does.

This is deliberately the opposite call from #397, which **refuses** an unsafe redirect
`Location` on the same octet class, and the difference is provenance rather than inconsistency.
A page's own `<a href>` is text that page authored and that a browser would encode before
fetching, so encoding reproduces what the link meant. A redirect `Location` is named by whatever
host answered; encoding it would invent a URL the origin never named while gori recorded it as
sent. Same class, same one predicate, different answer because the input is a different kind of
thing.

Encoded at **parse** (`Url.parse`), not in `build_get`, because a URL must have exactly one
spelling: `visit_key`, `template_key`, the Layer-2 gate question, the `Finding`, and the Sitemap
row `Persist` writes all come off the same `Parts`. Encoding only at the wire would leave the
raw octet in all five, so the scope would judge a different URL than the one sent — the exact
two-spellings bug `Url.gate_url` and the seed's `Url.normalize` were introduced to kill. It also
makes discover ask the gate the already-encoded form every other Layer-2 consumer sees, since
those targets arrive off the wire from a real client. The encoding is idempotent (`%` is not in
the class), which `#{bl.dir}#{cand}` and every re-crawled link rely on.

The **host** is refused rather than repaired, by `Url.parse` returning nil: percent-encoding is
defined for a path, not for a reg-name, and `Import::Builder::HOST_INVALID` already records that
a real host never carries one of these octets. That refusal turned out to close the question
#397 left open. #397 could not demonstrate a live path to the unguarded
`CONNECT #{authority} HTTP/1.1` in `proxy/upstream.cr`; there is one, and it runs through here.
A crawled `<a href="http://ac me.acme.test/x">` passes `Headers.safe_url?` (a space is not
CR/LF) and `same_or_subdomain?` containment, and with an upstream proxy configured its host
reaches `Upstream.dial_via_proxy` verbatim. Refusing at parse makes it unreachable, and refusing
at parse is the only place that covers BOTH synthesized request lines — the GET and the CONNECT —
since the CONNECT is built far below any Discover gate. `sender_spec` pins it on the socket.

`Sender#fetch` now refuses the whole class rather than CR/LF. That costs no coverage — the
repairable half never reaches it, having been encoded upstream — and it means the wire seam can
state the invariant it is there to state: a Discover run never puts a malformed or doubled
request line on a connection.

One instance of the same root cause is knowingly left open, because it is outside this
subsystem: `Import::Builder::CONTROL_CHAR` (`import/builder.cr`) still stops at `\x1f`, so a
raw space in a request target imported from a HAR or `--urls` file is stored and replayed
byte-exact. `HOST_INVALID` covers space, but only for the host.

### 2026-07-26: a path-confined run brute-forces its own subtree, and a run that sends nothing says so

Refines: [P4](#p4). Issue #395, adjacent to #393.

`seed_frontier` took the brute-force base from `Url.dir_of(seed)` — everything up to the last
`/` — while `@confine_path` was derived from the seed's full path. For a **file-shaped seed**
(a path with no trailing slash) the two disagreed: on `http://t/api`, `dir_of` is the origin
root `http://t/`, whose path is neither `/api` nor under `/api/`, so `enqueue_dir` went through
`bounded_url`, the confine refused it, and the seed's own subtree was never probed. With
`spider: false, bruteforce: true` — `gori run discover --target https://acme.test/api
--no-spider`, an ordinary invocation — that was the entire run: `sent=0 findings=[]`, a clean
`DoneEvent`, no reason given.

The issue offered two fixes, and the answer is a third that the confine's own documented meaning
already implies. Widening `@confine_path` from `/api` to `/` would spray the built-in wordlist —
`admin`, `logout`, `.git/config`, `.env` — at the origin root of a run the operator explicitly
scoped to `/api`, which is what the confine exists to prevent. Reporting "brute-force has
nothing to do" answers a question nobody asked: a seed path deeper than `/` means *the subtree
rooted here* (`confined?`), so **the brute-force base is that subtree's root as a directory**,
not the seed's containing directory. `/api` and `/api/` therefore both calibrate `http://t/api/`,
`/a/b` calibrates `http://t/a/b/`, and a seed at `/` is unchanged (no confine, so `dir_of`).

Two consequences are worth stating plainly rather than leaving a reader to discover them:

- The base appends a slash the operator did not type. `/api` and `/api/` are distinct resources
  on an origin that cares, and the probes now go under the latter. That is the only reading
  under which a file-shaped seed has a subtree at all, and it is what `build_discover_seed`
  already does when a run is seeded from Sitemap or History.
- A file-shaped seed with the spider on now calibrates **twice**, at `/api/` and at the origin
  root, where it previously calibrated once. The root calibration is the one #393 added to gate
  `robots.txt`/`sitemap.xml`; it used to be reached because `enqueue_dir` had FAILED and left
  `@dirs` empty. Both are needed once the subtree is really probed. The rows of the issue's
  matrix that already brute-forced something — `http://t/` and `http://t/api/` — are unchanged
  in both request count and destination.

`Url.parse` also now collapses a trailing bare `.`, the one dot-segment shape it let through
(`/a/.` trips none of `..`, `./`, `//`). That was harmless while nothing read the seed's path
back, but this entry's derivation does: a seed of `/api/.` produced the confine `/api/.`, which
nothing can satisfy, and the run went straight back to brute-forcing nothing.

Separately, as the general backstop: **a run that puts no request on the wire now ends in a
terminal `ErrorEvent`** (`Engine::NOTHING_TO_SEND`) rather than a `DoneEvent` with zero
findings. The condition is the send counter, deliberately, and not "seeding enqueued nothing" —
an empty frontier is only the shape this issue found. A frontier whose every task is refused
later by the per-URL Layer-2 gate ends in exactly the same silence, and `SCOPE_REFUSED` is a
benign error, so even the error count stays 0. That state became ordinary the moment the gate
started re-reading the scope mid-run (entry below). A run the operator STOPPED is exempt:
stopping before the first send is a decision, not a failure to have anything to do.

### 2026-07-26: Discover's Layer-2 gate reloads on the same schedule as every other sweep

Refines: [P5](#p5). Issue #396, surfaced by the review of #391.

The entry above for #354 records one reload semantic for the active-traffic scope gate: the
scope is re-read from its store before each Layer-2 check, throttled to
`Outbound::RELOAD_INTERVAL`, "uniform for every LONG-RUNNING job … on all three surfaces".
Discover was not honouring it. Its Layer 2 goes through the injected `ScopePolicy`
(`StoreScope#allowed?`) and not through `Outbound#sweep_block`, so `Outbound#refresh` was never
reached: `cli/run/discover.cr` and `mcp/tools/discover.cr` both use the `Outbound` for
`Plan.build` plus the up-front Layer-1 guard and then hand the engine a policy that never calls
back into it. The result was that `gori run project scope add exclude string logout` in a second
terminal stopped an in-flight fuzz, mine or sequence within a second, while an in-flight
discover — potentially thousands of probes — kept going against a start-time snapshot. Only the
TUI was exempt, and by accident: it shares its live `Scope` object, which its own `data_version`
poll reloads.

`StoreScope#allowed?` now performs the same throttled reload, reusing
`Outbound::RELOAD_INTERVAL` rather than naming a second interval — same clock-before-reload
ordering so concurrent worker fibers cannot stampede the store, same swallowed failure so the
last-known rules stay in force rather than the run breaking or failing open. Threading the
`Outbound` into the engine was rejected for the reason the `ScopePolicy` seam exists at all: the
engine is deliberately Store-free ([§2.1](#s2-1)).

**`configured?` is snapshotted at construction, and that is the load-bearing half of this
entry.** It answers "is there a scope to bound the crawl", which is what switches
`Containment::ScopeAware` between the same-origin fallback and `boundary?` — a Layer-1 question.
Delegating it live would let the reload rewrite the containment mode mid-run, and the direction
it rewrites in is catastrophic: on a project with no rules, an operator adding the single
canonical `exclude string logout` flips `configured?` false to true, and `matches_url?` requires
at least one INCLUDE (`Scope#allowlisted_unlocked?` — an excludes-only scope is deliberately not
an allowed range), so `boundary?` becomes false for every URL. The operator asked to skip one
path and the whole crawl would stop, silently, which is the [P4](#p4) failure the entry above
exists to remove. [§3](#s3) and the #354 entry already draw the line this respects: Layer 1's
strictness is settled per surface before the first byte, Layer 2 is the layer that is identical
everywhere and applied continuously. #396 asked for the second, not the first.

`boundary?` itself needs no reload of its own: its only caller (`bounded_url`) asks it
immediately after `allowed?`, so it already reads whatever that call refreshed.

### 2026-07-26: import is deliberately permissive — the host is a URL, the target is a payload

Refines: [P7](#p7). Issue #400.

Import (`src/gori/import/builder.cr`) feeds the replay path, so it obeys [P7](#p7): it stores and
replays operator-supplied malformed input byte-exact rather than sanitising it. A HAR, OpenAPI
spec or `--urls` file is a file the operator deliberately handed gori, describing traffic they
want to reproduce — a CRLF-bearing request line, a raw space in a target, a duplicate `Host` are
the smuggling *payloads* an operator tests with, not corruption to be repaired. Reproducing a
broken request is the point of the tool. This closes the inverse of how #400 was first filed:
the defect was never that a byte slipped *through* the denylist and replayed; it was that a
denylist rejected the operator's payload at all.

The split that makes this safe to state is **host versus target**:

- A control byte or space in the **path or query** is a URL describing a malformed request →
  store it, replay it byte-exact. `URI.parse` copies a literal control byte verbatim into
  `path`/`query`, and `request_head` writes the target onto the request line as-is, so the
  operator's forged message reaches the wire unchanged.
- A control byte or space in the **host** is not a URL at all — a parse failure, not a payload.
  `URI.parse` copies a reg-name authority verbatim, so `not a url at all` becomes a stored
  "host" of literal spaces. `Builder::HOST_INVALID` (`/[\x00-\x20\x7f]/`) rejects it in
  `endpoint`, and the parser's per-entry rescue skips just that entry. This is the ONE reject
  import keeps, and it is a shape check on a URL, not a judgement on a request.

One `CONTROL_CHAR` regex used to match anywhere in the URL and so did both jobs, rejecting the
payload case along with the parse-failure case; removing it and leaning on the pre-existing
`HOST_INVALID` restores the distinction. The send layer already encodes the same principle:
`Codec::Http1.request_token_safe?` (#399) documents itself as applying only where gori
*synthesizes* a request line from bytes a remote chose, never to operator-replay bytes.
`spec/repeater/import_replay_wire_spec.cr` pins that on the socket — an imported CRLF target
replays byte-exact through `Repeater::Plan`, and the guard's own verdict on those same bytes is
`false`, proving it does not gate the replay path.

Two adjacent guards are NOT relaxed by this decision and stay as they were: `HEADER_INJECT`
(CR/LF/NUL in a header name/value) and `reject_inject!` (the same in method / HTTP version /
reason phrase). Those forge a message boundary the same way a CRLF target does, and whether
import should also carry an operator's header-boundary payload is a separate question #400 did
not settle — left rejected pending its own call rather than widened by implication.

### 2026-07-30: an imported request's Host header is the operator's, and carries its port

Refines: [P7](#p7). PR #488 (the port) and its follow-up (the passthrough).

The entry above names "a duplicate `Host`" as one of the payloads import must preserve, but
`Builder.request_head` was doing the opposite: it skipped every incoming `Host` line and
synthesized one from `uri.host`. Two defects fell out of that, found by replaying imported
flows at a raw-echo origin and reading the bytes it received.

- `uri.host` never carries a port, so the synthesized line dropped it. RFC 7230 §5.4 requires
  the port whenever it is not the scheme default, so a HAR recording `Host: 127.0.0.1:8099`
  was stored — and replayed — as `Host: 127.0.0.1`. Name/port-based routing at the origin saw
  a different request than the one imported, and two imports differing only in port became
  indistinguishable by Host. Only the stored `host`/`port` columns were right, so the raw bytes
  and the JSON projection disagreed.
- Synthesizing at all discarded the operator's own bytes. A recorded `Host: evil.example`, or
  the duplicate `Host` this log already called a payload, was silently replaced — so the
  Host-header attack the operator imported could not reproduce.

Resolved as two halves of one rule: **a recorded Host goes out verbatim — order kept,
duplicates kept — and a Host is synthesized only when the source described none.** The
synthesized form now carries `host:port` unless the port is the scheme default
(`Builder.host_header`, reusing `Discover::Url.default_port?`). Sources that describe no
headers (`--urls`, OpenAPI) are the synthesize case; HAR/Postman/Insomnia are the passthrough
case. `Import::Raw` (Burp) never enters Builder and is unaffected.

Safe because gori already permits a Host that disagrees with the dialled host, deliberately:
the scope gate judges `Outbound.scope_url` — the host actually dialled — never the request
line or this header, which is what makes Host-header testing possible at all
([§3](#s3)). The two guards the entry above kept are untouched: `HEADER_INJECT` still rejects
CR/LF/NUL in any header, and `request_head` now applies the same check to the `host` it is
handed, since that field reaches the start of the head and could forge a boundary there.

### 2026-08-09: a crawler that will not read JavaScript cannot find a modern app

Refines: [P4](#p4).

Discover's two techniques both derive their targets from links, and both stopped at the same
wall. `Engine#extract_links` chose its parser from the response: robots.txt by role, a
`<loc>`-bearing body as a sitemap, an html-like content type as HTML — and **everything else as
`EMPTY_LINKS`**. The spider follows `<script src>` like any other link, so a run spent a real
request on the bundle, decoded it, fingerprinted it, and then discarded every route in it. On
anything SPA-shaped that is the whole application: an API route reachable only from JS is by
construction unlinked, so it was invisible to the spider *and* absent from any wordlist. The
same silence covered every JSON response.

Three changes, all inside the engine's existing gates:

- **`Extract.from_text`** takes the `else` branch. It looks for two shapes — an absolute
  http(s) URL, and a root-relative path *opening a quoted string* — because those are spelled
  identically in JS, JSON, YAML and plain text. The quote is the whole false-positive filter: a
  regex literal (`/foo/g`), a MIME type (`application/json`) and a date all fail it. It runs
  over inline `<script>` in HTML too, and `Engine#text_like?` keeps it off binary bodies, which
  a crawl following `<img src>` and `<link href>` meets constantly and which would each cost a
  full `String#scrub` to feed a regex no image can match.
- **`Engine::WELL_KNOWN`** replaces the hard-coded robots.txt/sitemap.xml pair with the
  registry: `sitemap_index.xml` (the Yoast spelling, and the majority of what `sitemap.xml`
  misses) and the `.well-known/` set, of which OIDC Discovery / RFC 8414 / RFC 9728 are the
  highest-yield documents gori fetches at all — one 200 names authorize, token, userinfo, jwks,
  revocation, introspection and registration as absolute URLs. `.well-known` and
  `.well-known/security.txt` *were* in the wordlist already, which is not the same thing: that
  probes them once per calibrated **directory**, never at the origin on a path-confined run,
  and reads nothing they say.
- **`Source::WellKnown`** carries them, and `Engine#well_known?` is the one predicate deciding
  both the routing and the confidence anchor. The 2026-07-26 entry above reasoned about
  "the seed and its two derived well-known paths"; nothing in that reasoning was about the
  number two. All of these are origin-anchored guesses at a fixed path, so all of them waive
  Layer 1 and the path confine, none of them waives Layer 2, and all of them are graded against
  the origin's soft-404 baseline rather than `record_page`'s raw-status trust — a wildcard-200
  origin answers 200 to `/.well-known/openid-configuration` exactly as readily as to
  `/robots.txt`.

Widening what one response yields makes the **orchestrator** the thing to watch, since
`consider_link` runs there and so does `enqueue_probes`, and that fiber is also the only one
dispatching jobs. Both were paid for in the same change: `Extract` de-duplicates within a body
and caps it at `MAX_LINKS`, and `Url.probe` derives a brute-force candidate by concatenation —
one string serving as both the frontier entry and the `seen` key, which are the same string for
any query-less URL. It is an optimization and never a second opinion: it declines every
candidate `Url.parse` would have rewritten, split or refused, and the caller falls back.
`bench/discover_extract_bench.cr` measures the directory loop at 546µs/805kB before and
233µs/251kB after, and `url_spec` pins `probe == parse` across the whole built-in list.

### 2026-08-09: a soft-404 baseline is a snapshot, and origins change their mind

Refines: [P4](#p4).

`Calibrate` recognises the four shapes of "not found" it was built for, and measuring it
against an origin serving all four confirms that: a custom-designed error page on a real 404,
a 200-everything soft-404, one that quotes the requested path back, and a 302-everything login
funnel each yielded the planted endpoint and nothing else. Two things it does *not* recognise
turned up in the same measurement, and they pull in opposite directions.

**A stale baseline reports the whole wordlist.** A `DirBaseline` is measured once, before a
directory's ~315 probes, and never revisited. When the origin's rate limiter tripped on the
8th request, every remaining probe diverged from that snapshot in status *and* length *and*
content — 0.50 + 0.25 + 0.35, clamped — so the run ended `320 found`, of which **310 were the
limiter, every one at confidence 1.0**. This is the ordinary case on a real engagement, not an
exotic one, and it is the worst failure the tool has: not a missed endpoint but a confident
lie, repeated 310 times.

A status guard (`429`/`503` are not evidence of existence) was considered and rejected as the
whole answer: the new uniform response is as often a 200 block page or a 403 as it is a 429,
so the shape to detect is *uniformity*, not a status class. `DirState` now carries the run of
consecutive cleared-and-alike outcomes, and `DRIFT_RUN` of them means the baseline no longer
describes the origin — re-measure the directory, and swap the new baseline into the `DirState`
every queued probe already holds a reference to. Three details are load-bearing:

- **The first member of a run is emitted; the rest are held.** At the moment it arrives, one
  diverging response is indistinguishable from a real finding, so it is reported. The second
  and later are held until the run either breaks (released — an ordinary directory pays only
  the latency of one more outcome) or reaches `DRIFT_RUN` (dropped). That bound is why
  `DRIFT_RUN` can be generous: raising it spends a few more requests, it does not leak more
  false positives, so 12 sits far above a real cluster of same-shell routes.
- **`drifted` is not enough; the baseline needs a GENERATION.** The flag covers the window
  between declaring drift and the re-measurement landing — and is cleared by the very swap
  that strands the probes still in flight, which were scored against the discarded snapshot.
  Caught in testing as a second false positive surviving the guard. A probe now reads the
  baseline and the generation together and carries the pair back; a mismatch means the verdict
  is evidence about nothing.
- **Re-calibration is capped** (`MAX_RECALIBRATIONS`). A limiter that relents and trips again
  would otherwise re-measure forever. Past the cap the directory stops producing findings and
  says so in `RunStats#drift_suppressed`, which all three surfaces now render.

**And the same measurement found the opposite error.** `WildcardOk` required
`fp_novel && length_div`, and the length band is proportional — `max(16, max // 20)`, 5% of the
page. A real page sharing the error page's template, which is what a CMS or SPA soft-404 always
is, lands inside that 5%: a 524-byte `/soft/admin` against a 545-byte soft-404 sat inside
`[518, 572]` and was never reported, however different its content.

Relaxing it to `fp_novel` alone produced **15,013 findings in one directory** against the
path-echoing origin — because there, content divergence *is* the echo. So the conjunction is
now conditional on a measured property rather than assumed, and the measurement is a byte
search, not an inference: each calibration probe looks for its OWN name in its OWN body. It
has to be direct, and the reason is the good kind of subtle. `Fingerprint.dynamic?` skips
all-hex runs of 12 or more so that ids and hashes cannot move a hash, and `bogus_name` is
exactly 16 hex characters — the reflected name is invisible to the very hash the reflection
would show up in. Inferring the echo from an out-of-cluster fingerprint fails too, and fails in
the direction that matters: one extra token in an 80-token page moves a simhash by fewer bits
than `simhash_distance`, while `swagger/v1/swagger.json` contributes four and clears it, so the
inferred test is *less* sensitive than the thing it predicts. The byte search costs no extra
request, and `DirBaseline#label` reports `wildcard-200 (echoes path)` so an operator can see
which of the two they got.

Net, on the five-variant origin: 320 findings with 310 false positives became 12 with 1 — the
single unavoidable one — while `/soft/admin`, which no configuration could previously surface,
is now found.

### 2026-08-16: a race is a count on the plan, not a fifth attack Mode

Refines: [P0](#p0). PR #705.

The Fuzzer's Race (last-byte-sync) mode arrived as `Config#race_count : Int32?`
(`src/gori/fuzz/types.cr`) rather than as a member of `Fuzz::Mode`, which still holds exactly
`Sniper`, `BatteringRam`, `Pitchfork`, `ClusterBomb`.

`Mode` answers one question: how do payload lists combine into the sequence of requests a run
sends. All four members are read by `Generator`, and every one of them produces a stream of
*different* requests. A race produces N copies of the *same* request and bypasses
`Mode`/`Generator` entirely (`Fuzz::Engine#run_race`). Modelling it as a fifth member would
have put a value into an enum that the enum's only consumer cannot consume, and forced an
inert arm into the exhaustive `case` in all three surfaces — structure added to describe a
thing that does not have that shape.

The cost of the choice is that "race" is not spelled the way the other attack shapes are, and
a surface must know to read a second field. That is the right trade while `race_count` is the
only such knob; a second orthogonal send-shape would be the concrete second caller P0 asks
for, and the two should then be generalized together rather than one of them retrofitted into
`Mode`.

### 2026-08-16: a refused send is not an enforcement result

Refines: [P4](#p4). Issues #707, #710.

Extends the 2026-07-26 decision that a run which sends nothing says so, to the case where the
answer is not merely empty but *actively misleading*.

The Authorize tool replays one captured request under several identities and reports whether
access control held. Its verdicts therefore carry a claim about the target. When gori's own
Sandbox or an EXCLUDE rule refuses every send, the run has learned nothing about the target
at all — but the shape of the result is indistinguishable from the shape of a run where the
server rejected every non-baseline identity. Reporting that as `enforced` would state the
strongest possible finding on the strength of traffic that never left the process.

So `Authorize` reports `nothing_sent`, never `enforced`, when every send was blocked, and
says in the same breath that this is not evidence access control works
(`src/gori/mcp/tools/authorize.cr`, `src/gori/cli/run/authorize.cr`). The same reasoning
makes an all-skipped selection raise `PlanError::NothingToSend` carrying the per-flow skip
list rather than returning an empty plan: "we declined to test these four requests, here is
why" and "we tested them and found nothing" are opposite findings and must not share a
rendering.

Authorize also shipped in #707 as a TUI-only tool, against the convention in [§2](#s2) that
every tool reaches all three surfaces over a shared `Plan.build` seam. #710 added
`src/gori/authorize/plan.cr`, `gori run authorize` and the MCP `authorize_*` family. Recorded
here because the gap was not noticed until a structure review looked for it: a new tool's
parity is part of shipping it, not a follow-up, and the seam is the thing that makes the two
non-TUI surfaces cheap enough for that to be true.

### 2026-08-17: a WebSocket flow exports as its handshake plus `_webSocketMessages`

Refines: [P7](#p7). PR "HAR export/import WebSocket messages".

`Export::Har` skipped every `101` by status, on the stated grounds that HAR "has no
representation for WebSocket messages". That was true of the 1.2 spec and false of the format
as it is actually used: Chrome DevTools writes the transcript into an `_webSocketMessages`
array on the entry, and every reader that renders a captured socket reads it. The cost of the
skip was that the one artifact an operator hands to a teammate dropped the only evidence a
WebSocket test produces.

The two obvious repairs were both worse than the skip. Folding the messages into a fabricated
request/response writes an exchange that never happened and — as `skip_reason`'s own comment
says about a status-0 entry — imports straight back as a real one. Inventing a gori-native
field nothing else reads keeps the evidence unreadable to the reader it was exported for.

So the handshake is written as **itself** — it is a real request and a real response — and the
messages ride beside it in Chrome's field. `Import::Har` reads them back into `ws_messages`,
which makes the transcript part of the export→import→export fixed point rather than a one-way
rendering. P7 governs what survives: a message payload keeps its exact bytes, base64 when they
are not valid UTF-8, because an invalid-UTF-8 TEXT frame is an RFC 6455 §8.1 test case and not
corruption to repair. Control frames and the relay's own `[gori] …` advisory rows travel too,
in position, since where an advisory sits is what names the frames it is about.

Two things do not survive, and are stated where they are made rather than left to be
discovered: the V7 frame **shape** has no field in the format (`Export::Har.ws_messages`), and
a message time keeps millisecond fidelity, the same commitment `startedDateTime` already makes
(`Export::Har.epoch_seconds`). `Skip::WebSocket` still exists and now means exactly one thing:
a socket whose transcript is EMPTY, where the entry would carry the upgrade and stand in for
frames that were never captured.

### 2026-08-17: a length declaration is repaired only when asked, and only when unambiguous

Refines: [P7](#p7). PR 7 (the gRPC reframe opt-in).

A gRPC message carries a 5-byte length prefix, and an operator's edit — a hex edit in the
Repeater's gRPC tab, a fuzz payload spliced into the message — changes the payload without
changing that declaration. A real gRPC server rejects the result, and gori used to report
`3 sent · 0 errors` over it. That was fixed by *saying so*: `Fuzz::Progress#grpc_stale`
counts the requests a payload left mis-framed and every surface names it once.

The obvious next step — resync it, the way `Content-Length` is resynced — is the one P7
forbids by default. A deliberately-wrong length prefix is one of the standard gRPC parser
tests, and the same argument `--verbatim` makes for Content-Length makes it here: the bytes
are the test case. So the repair is **opt-in** (`--reframe-grpc`, MCP `reframe_grpc`,
`Fuzz::Config#reframe_grpc?` / `Repeater::PlanOptions#reframe_grpc?`), default **false**, and
the two length declarations in one request deliberately carry **opposite** defaults:
Content-Length is recomputed unless told not to, the gRPC prefix is left alone unless told to.

Even under the opt-in the repair happens only where it is UNAMBIGUOUS. `Proxy::H2::Grpc.reframe`
answers nil — leave the bytes — for a body that already frames end-to-end, for a
client-streaming body (where every prefix present is honest and collapsing them would send a
different message), for a broken streaming body (where "which message grew?" is no longer
answerable from the bytes), and for `grpc-web-text` (whose frames are base64, so no rewrite
stays size-preserving). What is left is the unary case, which is the same shape the Repeater's
gRPC tab has always called reframable. A request the reframe declines is still counted and
still named, so the opt-in never trades a warning for a corrupt body.

Being size-preserving is what lets it run late: only the four length octets change, so the
Content-Length framed over the body stays correct and `Fuzz::Generator`'s payload spans do not
move. It is applied where each tool's bytes become the message — `Generator#emit`, beside the
Content-Length pass, for fuzz; `H2Engine.parse_request` for the Repeater, so the projection
`encoded_request` reports the wire through (MCP `effective_request`, `run show --format raw`)
shows the bytes the send will actually put on it.

### 2026-08-17: Authorize identities are session slots; Bindings is per-slot

Refines: [P4](#p4), [P5](#p5). Extends the 2026-08-16 Authorize entry.

gori had no multi-session primitive. `Env` is one value per key, and `Bindings` (#501) was a
single process-global name→value table, so a project could carry exactly one `$SESSION` at a
time. Authorize needed several and grew its own private answer: an `Identity`, which was a
static header overlay it applied to a captured request before replaying it. That answer was
right and it was in the wrong place — every *other* send seam needed the same thing, and a
second copy under a second name would have made "the admin session" mean one thing in the
Authorize tab and another at a Repeater send.

So there is one type. A **session slot** (`src/gori/session_slot.cr`) is a name, a header
overlay (`set_headers` upsert / `remove_headers` strip), and the extract rules whose observed
values belong to it. `Authorize::Identity` is an alias of it, and the two persist as one JSON
list in one settings row — still keyed `authorize_identities`, because an existing project's
identities *are* its slots and renaming the row would orphan them on upgrade.

`Bindings` is namespaced by that list (`src/gori/session_slots.cr`). A rule some slot claims
writes that slot's table; a rule no slot claims keeps writing the one global table it always
did, which is what makes every playbook written before slots existed keep working unchanged
(`docs/content/playbooks/carry-a-session.md`). Resolution reads the global table with the
**active** slot's written over it, so a slot *shadows* a name rather than introducing a second
syntax to spell — `$SESSION` stays `$SESSION` and the active slot decides whose it is.

The active slot is the send context, and it is applied at the seams that own a request going
onto the wire — `Repeater::Sender`, `Fuzz::Sender`, the intercept forward, and `--bind-from`
by way of the first. `Env.overlay_slot` runs *after* `Env.expand_bindings`: the message's own
references resolve first, then the identity is written over the result, and a `$NAME` inside a
slot's own header value resolves against that slot's table (so `Authorization: Bearer $SESSION`
means one thing on the "admin" slot and another on "user", off one persisted string each).

Three lines this deliberately does not cross:

* **The overlay is header-only.** Content-Length never moves and the body is byte-exact, which
  is what makes it safe to apply to bytes the operator did not author — a captured replay, a
  fuzz template with its payload already spliced. `as-captured` (and no slot at all, the
  default) is the no-overlay baseline.
* **Values still never reach disk.** A slot changes *where* a value lives, never *whether* it
  persists. The active pointer is memory-only for the same reason: restoring "admin is active"
  into an empty admin table on reopen would hand the next send an overlay whose `$SESSION` is
  literal — a 401 with no visible cause.
* **No cookie jar and no auto-login.** A slot carries headers the operator wrote and bindings
  gori observed. RFC 6265 storage, path/domain matching and expiry are a different feature with
  different failure modes, and a macro that decides for itself when to re-authenticate is gori
  acting behind the operator's back (P4). `--bind-from` already replays one flow the operator
  named, which is the same job done explicitly.

The surfaces for selecting and editing slots (TUI, `gori run`, MCP) landed next — see the
2026-08-17 *session slots reach all three surfaces* entry below.

### 2026-08-17: an h2 intercept may buffer a complete body; Match&Replace body still forces h1

Refines: [P4](#p4), [P6](#p6), [P7](#p7). PR #6.

Every HTTP/2 intercept hold used to cover the HEAD only. The reason was structural rather than
a limit: `H2::StreamGate` defers a stream's opening header block and *parks every frame that
arrives behind it* — nothing may overtake a deferred head (RFC 9113 §5.1.1) — so the body was
already in gori's hands, and the hold showed a human the head anyway. A body typed into the
editor was discarded, and `Interceptor::Item#head_only?` existed to let each surface say so
before it acked an edit it could not apply.

The hold now covers head+body when the message declares a `content-length` at or under
`H2::StreamGate::MAX_HOLD_BODY` (1 MiB), or when its head carries END_STREAM and so *is* the
whole message. The queue row then carries the entity, an edit's body is the operator's, and
`release_locked` re-frames it into DATA — moving END_STREAM onto the last DATA frame when the
head had carried it, and leaving it on the trailers when trailers end the message.

Three exclusions keep the head-only hold, each for its own reason rather than by omission:

* **No declared length** — a streaming upload, SSE, a gRPC stream. Buffering means waiting, and
  a body whose end gori cannot predict is a wait with no end ([P6](#p6)).
* **Over the ceiling.** 1 MiB is deliberately below h1's own hold ceiling
  (`ClientConn::MAX_REWRITE_BODY`, 16 MiB), and the asymmetry is the protocol's: an h1
  connection carries one request, an h2 connection multiplexes ~100 concurrent streams, so the
  same number would be a per-connection budget 100x larger on a single-threaded scheduler.
* **A PADDED DATA frame.** Stripping §6.1 padding is `Assembler#data_block`'s job, and a second
  copy of it on the pump fiber would raise where the assembler projects around the failure.

Two consequences are worth stating because they are behaviour changes, not refinements:

1. **The queue row appears when the message finishes arriving, not when its head does.** That is
   h1's own timing (`ClientConn` reads the whole entity before `hold_request`), but on h2 the
   wait also delays later stream opens behind it, because releases follow `@opens` order. It is
   bounded by the declared-length gate — gori only ever waits for an end it can predict — by
   `check_ceiling`, which fails the whole run of slots open past `MAX_DEFERRED_BYTES` plus the
   body it agreed to buffer, and by toggle-off. That last one needed a new seam: a hold still
   buffering has no queue row, so `Interceptor#toggle`'s release cannot reach it. The gate asks
   `Interceptor#holding?` when a frame arrives instead, which is sufficient rather than merely
   cheap — a waiting slot with nothing behind it blocks nobody, and a stream blocked behind one
   only becomes blocked when its own frames reach the gate.
2. **`restore_content_length` does not run on a buffered hold.** The R3-F2 rule (#513) reverts a
   `content-length` an editor computed *for* the operator, because on a head-only hold it
   described bytes gori was not going to send. When the body is held, the edit's body *is* what
   gori sends, so a synced value is simply true and a mismatched one is the §8.1.1 probe the
   operator opened the editor to run. Both go out verbatim — which is what h1 already does with
   the identical edit ([P7](#p7)).

**Match&Replace over a body still forces the h1 downgrade** (`Tls::Tunnel#h2_candidate?`), along
with a body-scoped extract rule and a short-circuit stub, and this decision does not weaken that.
A hold buffers *one* message a human is already waiting on, under a declared length, with the
operator watching. A body rule rewrites *every* matching message on the connection, unattended,
including the ones with no declared length at all — the shapes the hold explicitly refuses to
buffer. They are different bargains, and the downgrade is the honest answer for the second one
until #492 step 5 makes it unnecessary.

### 2026-08-17: a channel that cannot carry the bytes is not a reason to refuse the edit

Refines: [P7](#p7). The WebSocket half of Intercept and of Repeater.

Two surfaces had, for the same reason, stopped short of what the operator was holding the
message to do.

The intercept editor refused to open on a WebSocket BINARY message (opcode 2). The refusal
was correct about its premise — the TextArea round trip is `String.new(raw)` → char ops →
`.to_slice`, which is lossy on non-UTF-8, and on WebSocket that is the common case rather
than the exception — but it answered a *channel* problem by removing the *capability*. You
could hold a protobuf frame, read it, forward it and drop it, and not flip the byte you were
holding it to flip. The answer is the byte channel gori already had: `Tui::HexEdit`, the
Repeater's `^X` buffer, an `Array(UInt8)` that never becomes a String
(`src/gori/tui/intercept_view.cr`, `hex_editing?`). The lossy path is still never taken; it
is simply no longer the only path offered. Where a surface genuinely has no byte channel the
refusal stands and is named — MCP `raw` and CLI `--raw` are text, and both point at
`raw_base64` / `--raw-file` instead.

The WebSocket repeater wrote every recorded client→server message and only then read
(`src/gori/repeater/ws_engine.cr`). A socket carries a conversation, so a script whose Nth
message depends on the answer to the (N-1)th replayed as a burst the server was answering out
of step, and the transcript listed every "out" row ahead of every "in" row whatever the wire
order had been — a derived view contradicting the bytes, which is what P7 exists to forbid.
It now sends one message, drains the answer, and sends the next; the caps and the reassembly
buffer became session state (`DrainState`) so they still bound the whole run and a message
fragmented across an idle gap is still one message. Draining between messages is also what
lets the engine learn mid-script that the peer closed or went away, so it stops and reports
how far it got rather than appending "out" rows for bytes it never wrote. A CLOSE the
*operator* wrote is not a stop condition: "data frames after a CLOSE" is a §5.5.1 test, and
this engine deliberately lets them run it, as it already lets them send a lone CONT or an
unmasked frame.

Not changed, and not by omission: `permessage-deflate` stays unnegotiated and
`Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` stays stripped, and a WebSocket message is still held only when the
catch condition names `proto:ws`.

### 2026-08-17: a declared length is not a deadline

Refines: [P6](#p6). Extends the h2-intercept-buffers-a-body entry above. PR #11.

That entry called the buffering wait bounded, and named its bounds: the declared-length gate
(`holdable_body`), `check_ceiling`, and toggle-off. Two of those three count **bytes that
arrived**, and the third needs a human. So the shape none of them saw was the peer that sends
*nothing*: `POST` with `content-length: 4096` and then silence. No byte arrives, so the ceiling
has nothing to measure; no queue row exists, so `Interceptor#toggle`'s release has nothing to
hand back; and in the request direction that slot sits at the head of `@opens` with every later
stream on the connection parked behind it. A `content-length` promises how big a body is, not
that it is coming.

The wait now has a clock as well as a ceiling. `Slot#waiting_since` is stamped when the hold
starts buffering, and `check_waiting_locked` — which already ran on every inbound frame, for
toggle-off — gives the wait up past `H2::StreamGate::HOLD_WAIT_DEADLINE` (5 seconds) **with
intercept still on**. The exit is the one that was already there rather than a new refusal:
`queue_hold_locked(slot, held, nil)`, i.e. the head-only hold every h2 intercept had before
PR #6. The operator gets a row to forward or drop, the streams behind it move as soon as they
do, and the DATA that eventually turns up streams past untouched.

Still frame-driven, still no timer fiber, and that is the same argument the toggle-off check
makes rather than a weaker version of it: a waiting slot with nothing behind it costs nobody
anything, and the frame that makes a second stream *blocked* — its own HEADERS — is itself an
arrival at this gate, which checks before it defers. A fiber per buffering hold would buy only
the case where the wait is free, and would buy it on the pump's own path ([P6](#p6)).

The cost is stated rather than hidden: a genuinely slow upload that takes more than five
seconds between its head and its last DATA frame is shown to the operator head-only, and its
body goes out unedited. That is a real regression against "the row carries the entity" for slow
honest peers, and it is the trade — gori cannot tell a stalled peer from a slow one without
waiting, and the thing on the other side of the wait is every other stream on the connection.
Nothing else moves: `MAX_HOLD_BODY`, `check_ceiling`'s blasting-peer disposition, and the
"the row appears when the message is complete" timing for bodies that arrive in time are all
unchanged.

### 2026-08-17: a WebSocket drain deadline bounds work, not waiting

Refines: [P6](#p6). Extends the interleaved-WebSocket-repeater entry above. PR #12.

Interleaving made every recorded message wait out an idle gap before the next one left, and
`DRAIN_DEADLINE` was still charged the whole exchange from one `DrainState#started`. So the
60s deadline had quietly become a cap on SCRIPT LENGTH: at the TUI's 3s idle a healthy
30-message subscribe/ack replay was cut off around message 20 — by an origin that had answered
every single message promptly — and `with_unsent_note` blamed "a capture cap", pointing the
operator at `MAX_RECV_*` knobs that had nothing to do with it.

Idle waiting is not work, so it is not charged. A read that ends in `IO::TimeoutError` produced
no frame, and `DrainState#credit_idle` pushes `started` forward by exactly that gap; what the
deadline measures is time spent READING frames, across the whole exchange. The three capture
caps (`MAX_RECV_MESSAGES`, `MAX_RECV_BYTES`, `MAX_DRAIN_FRAMES`) are unchanged and stay
session-wide — they bound how much was captured, which is a different question from how long
the engine ran.

The deadline still exists and still fires, on exactly the case it was written for: an origin
that never goes idle (a keepalive cadence under the idle timeout) is credited nothing, stays
100k frames clear of `MAX_DRAIN_FRAMES`, and would otherwise pin the tab "inflight" for hours.
That stop is now NAMED as the deadline in the unsent-message note, distinct from a capture cap,
because the two have different fixes.

`WsEngine.send` takes the deadline as a parameter defaulting to `DRAIN_DEADLINE`, for the
reason `idle` is already one: the bug is a RATIO (a script longer than `deadline / idle`
messages), and a spec cannot demonstrate it at 60s-scale in a run anyone will wait for. No
surface passes it.

### 2026-08-17: session slots reach all three surfaces

Refines: [P1](#p1), [P4](#p4). Extends the 2026-08-17 session-slots entry. PR #10.

The engine landed with no way to reach it: a slot could only be edited from the Authorize
tab's identities card, and NOTHING could select the active one, so `Env.overlay_slot` was a
seam every send seam called and no operator could arm. This closes that on all three
surfaces at once, as thin adapters — no engine was re-derived, and the layering check
(`spec/layering_spec.cr`) still finds no surface name in `session_slot.cr` /
`session_slots.cr` / `bindings.cr`.

The split each surface makes is the same, and it is the persistence split: **the list is
configuration, the active pointer is send state.**

* **List editing** is one method set on `SessionSlots` (`add` / `update` / `remove` /
  `set_baseline`), so "exactly one baseline" is decided once rather than three times. The
  TUI's identities card is unchanged as a card — but it now reads and writes through
  `Session#slots` instead of the settings row underneath it. That was a live bug: the card
  wrote `Store::AUTHORIZE_IDENTITIES_KEY` directly, so the registry `Bindings` and
  `Env.overlay_slot` hold kept the pre-edit list, and the Authorize tab and a Repeater send
  disagreed about what "admin" was until the project was reopened.
* **Activation** is a picker (`session.slot`, Global/palette, plus a clickable `session:NAME`
  top-bar chip) in the TUI, `set_active_session_slot` on MCP, and `--slot NAME` on
  `gori run repeater|fuzz|mine|sequence|discover`. There is deliberately no
  `gori run session activate`: a `gori run` process sends and exits, so a pointer has nothing
  to span, and persisting one is the exact failure the engine entry rules out. Typing it
  anyway is answered with the flag rather than "unknown subcommand".

Two consequences worth stating because they are UX contracts, not details:

1. **The active slot is READ OUT wherever a send is initiated.** An overlay is applied after
   the editor's bytes, so the Repeater pane shows one request and the wire carries another;
   the `session:NAME` chip, the Repeater's `sending as NAME → host` line, `gori run`'s
   `slot: sending as NAME` on stderr, and MCP's `active` field are the four places that
   reconcile them. The chip is ABSENT while nothing is active — as-captured is the default,
   and a chip that only appears while an overlay is in force makes its appearance the signal.
2. **`--slot` is applied before `--bind-from`.** The seed replay fills the tables of whichever
   slots claim each matched rule, and the run then resolves `$NAME` out of the active one; the
   other order would seed one identity and send as another.

Header values are `[REDACTED]` by default on both new list surfaces (`gori run session list`,
MCP `list_session_slots`), matching `list_env` and the identities card's names-only rows: a
slot's whole job is carrying a credential, and a list is scrollback. `--set` / `set_headers`
parse through `Discover::Headers.parse_lines` — the same parser the TUI form uses — so a
CR/LF-carrying value is refused by name on every surface rather than dropped on one.

### 2026-08-17: the reframe default splits by surface, and hex-editable is not reframe-on-send

Refines: [P1](#p1), [P4](#p4), [P7](#p7). Extends the 2026-08-17 gRPC-reframe entry. PR 13.

The reframe opt-in landed on two of the three surfaces. `gori run fuzz --reframe-grpc` and MCP
`reframe_grpc:` set `Fuzz::Config#reframe_grpc?`; the TUI's Fuzzer never did, so a knob that
exists in the engine was unreachable from the tab most operators actually fuzz from. That is
now a toggle on the ADVANCED card, sitting directly under `Auto Content-Length` because they
are the same kind of knob pointed at the two length declarations one gRPC request carries —
and carrying the opposite default, exactly as the engine entry says they must. The view
neither reframes nor decides what is reframable: it sets one boolean on the `Fuzz::Config`
that `build_engine` already hands `Plan.build`, and `Generator#emit` is unchanged.

The Repeater's gRPC tab had the inverse problem: it reframed *always*, because
`grpc_reframable?` was one flag meaning both "unary, so the payload is hex-editable" and
"reframe on send". Those are different kinds of fact — the first is a property of the capture,
the second is a decision — and fusing them meant the tab could not send what
`gori run repeater send` sends by default. They are split (`grpc_reframe?`, `␣F:FRAME`,
`repeater.toggle-grpc-reframe`); `^X` still needs the first, and only the second is flippable.

**The two defaults differ on purpose, and that is not a parity gap.** Headless the default is
off (P7): the operator names bytes and gori sends them, and a deliberately-wrong length prefix
is a standard gRPC parser test. In the Repeater's gRPC tab the default is **on**, because the
tab's whole reason to exist is that `^X` produces a well-formed unary message — a stale prefix
after a hex edit is the trap the tab already avoids, not a test anyone typed. Turning it off is
how an operator asks for the headless behaviour, and the badge says which one is armed. The
Fuzzer stays off on every surface: there the payload comes from a wordlist, not from a hand
edit, and `Fuzz::Progress#grpc_stale` already reports what a stale prefix cost the run.

Neither toggle is persisted anywhere new. The Repeater's is view state with the same lifetime
as its sibling send knobs (reset to on by `load_grpc`, carried by a tab duplicate); the
Fuzzer's rides the existing `config_json` blob, read back as `|| false` — the opposite of
`update_cl`'s `!= false` — so a session saved before the key existed starts OFF rather than
silently reframing bytes the operator never asked to repair.

### 2026-08-19: a case fold that costs 10x is bought only where it is needed

Refines: [P6](#p6). PR: source audit.

QL's substring fields (`host:` / `path:` / `url:` and bare free text) folded the NEEDLE with
Crystal's full-Unicode `downcase` and the HAYSTACK with SQLite's built-in `lower()`, which is
ASCII-only. For a needle carrying a non-ASCII letter the two never met: a captured
`/Überweisung` was unreachable by `path:` in EVERY spelling, and `InterceptFilter` — the
in-memory implementation of the same predicate — matched the row while History did not. That is
the SQL-vs-memory divergence the 2026-08-13 scope entry already ruled against.

`gori_ci_contains` (Crystal's `downcase.includes?` as a per-connection UDF, `Store::ScopeMatch`)
answers it exactly, and `scope.cr` already routes a `string` rule through it. Routing EVERY
substring term through it does not: measured over 100k flows, `host:` answers in **7ms** through
`lower(col) LIKE ?` and **71ms** through the UDF. Both forms full-scan, so the 10x is not a lost
index — it is a Crystal callback plus two String allocations per row, and History recompiles this
filter on every keystroke. P6 says never stall the data path, and 71ms per keystroke is a stall.

**So the fold is chosen by what the NEEDLE contains** (`QL.contains_cond`): an ASCII needle keeps
the native LIKE, a non-ASCII needle takes the UDF. Every ASCII character folds identically in the
two implementations, so the fast path is exact for the needles that take it — and the whole
pre-existing `spec/ql_spec.cr` SQL corpus is unchanged, which is the evidence for that claim.

Two things this deliberately accepts, recorded rather than hidden:

1. **A residue on the fast path.** A haystack character that folds INTO ASCII under Unicode but
   not under `lower()` — `İ`→`i`, `K`(U+212A)→`k`, `ſ`→`s` — stays unreachable by an ASCII needle.
   Closing it means paying the 10x on every query to serve a case nobody has reported.
2. **Two spellings of one predicate**, which the scope entry warns about. It is safe here only
   because `host`, `method` and `target` are all `NOT NULL`: a NULL haystack would make the arms
   disagree under `NOT` (`NOT (NULL)` drops the row, `NOT (0)` keeps it). A nullable column added
   to this set must re-derive that, not inherit it.

### 2026-08-20: the received request-line is judged by a different rule than the one gori writes

Refines: [P7](#p7). PR: recent-merge audit.

`Codec::Http1.request_token_safe?` is the one home for "may this text go on a request line as one
token" — CR/LF/NUL/SP/HTAB/DEL all refused — and AGENTS.md lists re-deriving it next to a new
caller as a trap. #729's non-HTTP detector (`looks_like_http_request?`) cited that rule and applied
it to the first received byte. Doing so was the trap in the other direction.

The rule is correct for a line gori **synthesizes** (Discover's crawled `href`, the MCP request
builder, the fuzzer's redirect follower): there, an SP is gori forging a request the operator did
not write. It is wrong for a line gori **receives**, where an SP is the operator's payload.
` GET /admin HTTP/1.1` — whitespace before the request-line — is a standard smuggling / WAF
parser-differential probe, and it was being killed at the connection with the flow blaming
`network.tls_passthrough` for the tester's own request. That is exactly the false-positive class
the predicate's own comment swears off, and it sat one row from the `\r\n`-prefixed case
`spec/proxy/codec/http1_spec.cr` already protected.

**So SP and HTAB are carved out of the detector's reject set** (C0-minus-whitespace, plus DEL). No
binary preface begins with SP or HTAB — MQTT `0x10`, AMQP `0x00`, a TLS ClientHello `0x16` are all
caught unchanged — so the carve-out costs nothing the detector exists to buy.

Two things this accepts, recorded rather than hidden:

1. **A whitespace-prefixed non-HTTP protocol waits out the head deadline** again, exactly like the
   SSH/SMTP text banners #729 already documented as a known gap. Same trade, same reason: on the
   first byte a banner and a payload are indistinguishable, and gori does not guess.
2. **Two rules for one shape**, which is normally the thing to avoid. The split is the point here:
   `request_token_safe?` governs what gori WRITES, `looks_like_http_request?` what it READS, and
   a future reader tempted to unify them should re-read P7 first.

### 2026-08-20: a CONNECT gori cannot decode is refused in the open, not relayed in the dark

Refines: [P4](#p4), [P7](#p7). Extends the entry above and #729. PR: #755.

#729 closed the case with bytes to judge. The two it left are both on the TLS path, and both were
silence rather than misclassification: a client that sends **nothing** (SMTP/IMAP/POP3/MySQL — the
SERVER greets first) timed out into `ClientConn#run`'s blanket rescue, and `handle_connect`'s peek
routed `0x50` to the h2c relay and **everything else to a TLS server handshake**, so SSH-over-
CONNECT died in OpenSSL — after `reflect_origin_h2` had already fired a real ALPN-`h2` ClientHello
at the SSH server's port.

Two decisions worth writing down, because both had a tempting alternative.

**The timeout stays; what is RECORDED gets narrower.** "Not HTTP" cannot be separated from "slow
HTTP" by clock (#729), and shortening the wait weakens the slowloris bound `HEAD_DEADLINE` exists
for. So the fix is a predicate, not a duration: a flow is recorded only for a connection that sent
**zero** bytes (`Http1::HeadTimeout#received`) and had **never carried a request**
(`@saw_request`). Drop either term and the normal end of a healthy keep-alive connection starts
writing flows, which is the noise that makes the signal worthless. One innocent shape survives
both terms — a browser's speculative preconnect — and is named in the message rather than filtered
out, because on the wire it is not distinguishable from the case being reported.

**Both halves of the peek widened, not just the TLS one.** `0x50` is `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH` and
`PROPFIND` as well as `PRI`, so the same one-byte assumption sent a plaintext request tunnelled to
port 80 into the HTTP/2 relay — which dials the origin and then dies at `Frame.read_preface` —
while the identical request spelled `GET` took the refusal arm. Behaviour split on the first letter
of the method. `Server` had already solved this for its listeners with a four-octet floor and a
comment stating that a CONNECT tunnel carries only a ClientHello or a preface; that premise is what
this entry refutes, so the predicate moved to `H2::Frame.preface_prefix?` and the TLS twin to
`Tls::ClientHello.record_start?`. Both callers now share one home, and only the two arms that
COMMIT to a protocol read past the first byte — every refusal still decides on one octet.

**A non-TLS CONNECT is refused, not blind-tunnelled**, though the code to relay it sits in the
next branch and doing so would make `ssh -o ProxyCommand='nc -X connect …'` work with no operator
action. #729 turned that trade down on its own terms and it still holds: a silent uncaptured relay
is the anti-pattern `settings/network.cr` names ("a bypassed host is otherwise INVISIBLE"), and
gori already HAS an explicit per-host spelling of exactly that relay. `Settings.tls_passthrough?`
is consulted one branch ABOVE the peek, so the refusal's advice is a one-step fix rather than a
description of some other mode — and the operator, not the first byte on the wire, decides which
hosts leave the capture path (P4).

**The listener peek needed the record too, not just `ClientConn`.** `Server#serve_reverse` and
`#serve_transparent` route on `client.peek`, which blocks *before* any `ClientConn` exists — and
those listeners are the only ones a plaintext server-speaks-first protocol can reach, since
SMTP/IMAP cannot traverse a forward proxy without a CONNECT. (The `socks5` listener, added later,
is a third: it reuses `peek_first` and records the same way, plus its own record for a client that
never sends the greeting.) Recording only in the request loop
would therefore have put the fix everywhere except where #729 says it matters most. Hence
`ClientConn.record_silent_client` in class form: one sentence, reachable without an instance. Those
two sites re-raise after recording, so the accept path still closes the fd and frees the slot — the
change is the silence, not the teardown.

Four things this accepts:

1. **`handle_connect`'s peek read staying silent when IT times out.** A client that opens a tunnel
   and then holds it without a ClientHello is a speculative preconnect, and it is not the shape
   above either — that one sent zero bytes, this one sent a CONNECT. A client that genuinely must
   let the far side speak first is served by listing the host, which skips the peek entirely.
2. **`Tunnel#intercept`'s handshake failure is a `gori.log` line, not a flow**, unlike the
   refusals beside it. There is no `RawRequest` to project one from — the request is exactly what
   the failed handshake prevented, the same reasoning `serve_h2c_prior_knowledge` already applies
   to its own refusal — and the dominant member of that population is a client that does not trust
   the CA yet, which retries. Threading a reason back out through the `TlsMitm#intercept` seam so
   `handle_connect` could record against the CONNECT it holds is the alternative, declined on
   seam-churn grounds for a diagnostic that says the same sentence every time.
   `intercept_self_page` keeps its bare rescue: a client reaches the CA-download page *because*
   it does not trust the CA, so a failure there is the expected first step, not a fault to report.
3. **One flow per silent connection, uncapped** — and the same for `refuse_non_tls_connect`. The
   bounded form (`notice_downgrade`'s once-per-{host, reason} set) is not reachable from a
   per-connection object, and both new records match the discipline of the sibling they sit
   beside: `record_non_http` (#729) and `refuse_h2c` (#731) each write one flow per occurrence for
   an equally retry-prone population. `Server`'s `MAX_CONNECTIONS` slot cap bounds the rate. If
   this floods, the four should get a shared bound together, not one of them alone.
4. **A text banner that speaks and then waits is still silent** — an SSH client that sends its
   banner and blocks for the server's has `received > 0`, so the zero-byte term excludes it. That
   is the term that keeps a slowloris drip from writing a flow per connection, and the banner is
   indistinguishable from a version-fuzzing payload on the first line anyway (the entry above).
   #729 left three shapes; this closes the two that can be told apart from a payload.

### 2026-08-22: an h3 `Alt-Svc` is removed only because the operator said so, and never in silence

Refines: [P4](#p4), [P7](#p7). No issue — the HTTP/3 half of a protocol-coverage sweep.

gori does not intercept HTTP/3. QUIC is UDP and every listener here is a TCP socket, so an
origin answering `Alt-Svc: h3=":443"` is inviting the client onto a transport nothing in this
process can read. What gori had was detection — `Probe::Passive::Tech`'s `tech_http3` and the
once-per-host `alt_svc_h3` event — and no remedy, which leaves the operator holding the one
failure mode where "I found nothing" and "I could not see it" look identical.

`network.strip_alt_svc` is that remedy, and it is **off by default** because of P4 rather than
caution. gori edits a message the operator did not ask it to edit in exactly one place today,
and that place earns it: leave `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` in the handshake and History presents
a deflate stream as the payload, so not editing would make gori lie about its own capture. An
unstripped `Alt-Svc` costs no capture fidelity. It costs a client, silently — which is a reason
to offer the switch, not to throw it for the operator.

Three decisions inside it:

1. **Per field, and only the fields that advertise h3.** `Alt-Svc: clear` is RFC 7838's "forget
   the alternatives you cached", the one spelling of this header gori most wants delivered; a
   plain `h2=":8443"` alternative is another TCP port, still tunnelled and still captured.
   Neither is removed. A field naming both goes whole rather than being re-spelled: value
   surgery would put gori's own rendering of a remote-chosen field on the wire for a saving
   that buys no visibility.
2. **Before Match&Replace, on both transports** — the opposite of where the 101's
   `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` strip sits, and not in disagreement with it. That one prevents a
   protocol desync and so must have the last word over any rule. This one is a blanket policy,
   so a response rule that puts the header back is the operator saying so about ONE host,
   explicitly, and that outranks a switch they threw for all of them.
3. **The store keeps what gori delivered**, which is the answer a Match&Replace head rewrite
   already gives, and the flow's `advisory` quotes what was removed. The consequence is worth
   stating rather than discovering: the passive rule reads the STORED head, so a CAPTURED
   response stops fingerprinting `tech_http3` once the strip is on. That is the right trade in
   both directions — the advisory carries the same evidence per flow, and the event was a
   warning about a bypass that can no longer happen. It is the proxy path only: a response
   gori itself elicited (Repeater, Fuzz, Discover, MCP `send_request`, import) is built by
   `Outbound`, never reaches the seam, and still carries the origin's `Alt-Svc` — which is the
   right way round, since the strip exists to keep a CLIENT on a readable transport and gori's
   own sender has no client to lose.

On HTTP/2 the strip costs the connection its HPACK passthrough: removing a field means
re-encoding the block, and re-encoding is one-way per direction (see `H2::HeadRewrite`'s class
comment), so every later response head on that connection is re-encoded too and gori's encoder
does not index. That is a bytes-on-the-wire price the operator buys visibility with, paid only
while the switch is on — and it is why the h2 half filters the decoded fields directly instead
of going through the h1-text rewrite seam, which refuses any head it cannot round-trip and
would therefore skip exactly the heads most worth stripping.

The parse has one home (`Gori::AltSvc`) and the probe rule delegates to it. Two spellings of
"advertises h3" would mean a flow flagged for a header gori had already taken off the wire, or
a header removed with nothing saying so.

Not addressed, and not fixable here: a host on `network.tls_passthrough` is never decrypted, so
its `Alt-Svc` cannot be stripped; and an h3 route can reach a client out of band (a DNS HTTPS
RR), which no response-side strip reaches. Nor is a field-name spelled with whitespace before
the colon (`Alt-Svc : h3=…`) — `parse_headers` keeps that name unstripped, so gori's own gate
does not recognise the field either, and a conforming recipient rejects it too (RFC 9112 §5.1).
The scan takes `parse_headers`' CRLF line view precisely so that it can never see a field the
projection did not: an LF-framed scan reached inside a value that smuggled a bare LF, and the
head it left behind cost the client a 200 it had been receiving with the switch off. An
obs-fold continuation is dropped with the field it belongs to, and the block is handed the
JOINED value — more than the projection records, deliberately, because this decides what
leaves the machine rather than what gori filed.

### 2026-08-22: a SOCKS5 listener is the pinned-destination path, with the CONNECT threat model

Refines: [P1](#p1), [P7](#p7). No issue — the inbound half of a protocol-coverage sweep.

gori spoke SOCKS5 in one direction only. `network.upstream_rules` has reached an origin THROUGH
someone else's SOCKS proxy for some time (`ssh -D`, Tor, a jump host), while a client that can be
pointed at a proxy but not at an HTTP one — `ALL_PROXY=socks5://`, a runtime whose only proxy
setting is SOCKS — had no way in short of a kernel redirect rule. The `socks5` listener mode is
that way in.

**It is not a new MITM path.** After the handshake, a SOCKS5 connection is the transparent
listener's situation with a better answer: a `{host, port}` from outside the byte stream, routed
on the first byte into the same three arms. `serve_transparent_tls` became `serve_pinned_tls`
when it acquired its second caller, which is what the body always was — TLS whose destination
was DECLARED rather than requested in-band, by the kernel or by a CONNECT request.

**The cleartext arm takes `fixed_host`, not `origin_dst`.** The reverse listener's shape, not
the transparent one's. `origin_dst` pins the DIAL and nothing else, which is right when the
destination came from the kernel and the `Host` header is the only name anyone has; here the
client DECLARED an authority, so on that arm the authority is what History and the scope gate
are told, and a `Host` the same client also chose does not outrank it. The header still goes to
the origin byte-exact (P7) — it is the client's own bytes, and gori is not being asked to
rewrite them. `CONNECT` is refused outright on any pinned connection, reverse included: it is
the one request shape that never reaches `resolve_forward`, so answering it at all would make
the pinned destination negotiable by the client that was just pinned to it.

**On the TLS arm the SNI still wins the NAME**, and that is not the same claim reversed. A
certificate has to be minted for the name the client is about to verify, so `serve_pinned_tls`
keeps `sni || dst[0]` — the leaf, the passthrough list, the Sandbox and History all follow the
SNI — while the DIAL is pinned to the declared destination. That is the split transparent mode
already had between a name and an address, and it is why `dial_addr` carries the SOCKS
destination rather than replacing the name with it. A ClientHello with no SNI falls back to the
declared destination for both.

**The guards do not come with the path.** `serve_transparent` deliberately carries no self-loop
test: `OrigDst.lookup` already refuses the socket's own address, and on that listener nothing
else chooses a destination. SOCKS5 hands the choice to the client, which is the forward-proxy
CONNECT threat model, so it gets the CONNECT answer — the loop test and the Sandbox gate both
run BEFORE `succeeded` goes back, and each refusal is a reply code (0x02, "not allowed by
ruleset") the client can report rather than a connection that drops for no stated reason. Two
tests and not one: `loops_to_self?` resolves host overrides first, so an override pointing back
at this listener is a loop the raw name does not show, while `Settings.serving_address?` is the
one a SOCKS5 client makes reachable at all — it can name a SIBLING socket, the primary
forward-proxy bind included, which no per-listener test sees. On the CLEARTEXT arm the
per-request `loops_to_self?` inside `ClientConn` stays armed on top of both (that one is per
REQUEST, and a keep-alive connection can carry a request for a host the handshake never named);
the TLS and h2c arms have no per-request leg to arm, which is why the handshake gate is where
this is decided rather than an extra layer of defence.

**Every refusal is a flow**, which is #729 and #755's lesson one protocol over. A SOCKS listener
that closes connections in silence is indistinguishable from a broken one, and the population
that reaches this listener by mistake — an HTTP client pointed at the wrong port, a tool asking
for UDP ASSOCIATE — is exactly the one that needs to be told.

Two deliberate refusals in the protocol itself. **NO-AUTH only**: the forward-proxy listener
beside it has no authentication either, and a SOCKS listener asking for a password would be
claiming an access control the rest of the process does not have. **CONNECT only**: BIND needs
a socket opened on the client's behalf, and UDP ASSOCIATE is a datagram relay — the same reason
HTTP/3 is out of reach, since every listener here is a TCP socket. Both are answered with the
code RFC 1928 defines rather than by hanging up.

The wire vocabulary has one home (`Proxy::Socks5`) and both ends use it. gori is now a SOCKS5
client and a SOCKS5 server in the same process; two spellings of what a byte means is how those
two would drift. The first-byte test on this listener is the TWO-byte `ClientHello.record_start?`
(#755) rather than the one-byte test the other listeners use, because a SOCKS listener is where
a non-HTTP protocol is most likely to arrive — `ssh -D` is what most people point at one — and
feeding an SSH banner into an OpenSSL server handshake because its first octet happened to be
0x16 helps nobody.

### 2026-08-23: a service description is a document, not the operator's payload

**Decision.** `Import::XmlMini` — the namespace-aware reader `Import::Wsdl` is built on —
REFUSES a `<!DOCTYPE>` outright, rather than ignoring it and carrying on. That is stricter than
P7, and the strictness is the point: the axis P7 actually names is provenance, and a WSDL is
not the class of bytes P7 protects.

`Import::Raw` is the P7 path. A Burp item's `<request>` holds the wire bytes the operator
captured and will replay; a lying `Content-Length`, a CRLF in the target and a duplicate `Host`
are the payload, and `import/burp.cr` goes out of its way not to scrub them. `Import::Burp`'s
own fixtures carry a benign DOCTYPE, because Burp writes one.

A WSDL holds no such bytes. It is a description gori READS in order to build a request that did
not exist before, and every octet of it reaches the wire only after passing through the XSD
skeleton generator. Nothing in it is evidence. So the two questions a DOCTYPE raises have
different answers than they would on the capture path:

* **Ignoring is not neutral.** An undeclared `&payload;` left in the document decodes to
  nothing, and the `<soap:address location="&payload;/svc">` it sat in becomes a silently WRONG
  endpoint — an import reported as a success that seeds requests at the wrong host. A refusal
  with a message is strictly better than a quietly corrupted seed request.
* **Refusing costs nothing.** Neither WSDL 1.1 nor XML Schema has any use for a DTD, so a
  DOCTYPE in a `.wsdl` is a generator bug or an attack, and no working document is lost.

The security consequence is a side effect of that, not the argument for it, and it is closed at
the root rather than by a counter someone has to remember to check. No external entity can be
declared, and `XmlMini` has no file or network I/O to dereference one with — so there is no XXE.
No internal general entity and no parameter entity can be declared, and `XmlText::NAMED_ENTITIES`
is the fixed five-entry XML predefined table where an unknown `&foo;` stays VERBATIM rather than
expanding — so entity expansion is O(1) in the input by construction, and billion-laughs has
nothing to expand. The same reasoning is why `Import::Wsdl` never follows an `xsd:import`
`schemaLocation`: an importer that fetches one is an importer with the I/O this reader exists
to not have.

Two smaller consequences of the same distinction. `XmlMini` SCRUBS invalid UTF-8 on the way in,
where `Import::Burp` must not — a byte that cannot be text has no meaning in a document whose
only outputs are names, URLs and placeholder values. And an out-of-scope PORT (an
`http:binding`, a JMS transport, a relative address) is reported as a NOTE rather than counted
in `skipped`: `skipped` means a malformed entry, and a .NET WSDL publishing `FooHttpGet` beside
`FooSoap` is not damaged. When nothing at all was generated the first note becomes the error
message, so "every port here is HTTP GET/POST" is a sentence the operator gets to read instead
of the generic "no flows found".

### 2026-08-23: the Fuzzer sweeps a WebSocket, and the handshake is part 0 of its position space

The Repeater could re-establish a WebSocket and replay its frames; the Fuzzer could not touch
one. `gori run fuzz --repeater N` and MCP `fuzz_start{repeater_id}` both refused a WS session in
so many words ("the Fuzzer sweeps HTTP requests, not a framed WebSocket exchange"), which left
the one protocol gori captures, filters (`proto:ws`), intercepts, exports and replays with no
path to the tool an operator reaches for after all of those. gRPC never had this gap and never
needed one: it is a content type over h2, and the Fuzzer has ridden h2 since it existed.

**One variation is one whole session** — dial, handshake, the payload-spliced frame script,
drain, close. The alternative, reusing one socket across payloads, is faster and dishonest: a
WebSocket is not request/response, so nothing attributes an inbound frame to the payload that
provoked it, and the engine's own `WsEngine.exchange` interleaves send-and-drain precisely
because a burst cannot be read back in step. Concurrency therefore means N simultaneous sockets,
which is what it costs to get an answer that means anything.

**A `Fuzz::WsScript` composes one `Template` per part under ONE global position index space**,
rather than a flat delimited pseudo-document. A frame payload is arbitrary bytes — a BIN frame, a
protobuf, a deliberately-invalid-UTF-8 §8.1 test — so no sentinel is safe (P0), and every
buffer-level pass in the pipeline would read a non-request: `urlencoded_positions` would find a
"form body" past the first blank line and `AutoEncode` would percent-encode into a JSON frame.
The composite works because every attack mode, `--mark`, each `¦chain` and the payload-set
contract are defined over the payload-VALUE vector and not over a buffer — so `Mode`,
`Generator`'s four mode methods, `PayloadSet` and `refuse_unusable_chains` are untouched.

**The handshake is part 0 of that space, not an un-fuzzable prefix.** A WS upgrade head IS an
ordinary HTTP request head, so `Template` already fits it; marking `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` or a
cookie in the upgrade is a real test that would otherwise need a refusal. It also keeps the four
passes that read a request as a request — `urlencoded_positions`, `AutoEncode`,
`ContentLength.sync_at`, `Outbound.request_target` — aimed at the one part that is one. The
frames get none of them, and `emit_ws` deliberately does not `shift_spans` a frame across the
handshake's Content-Length rewrite: they are separate buffers, and shifting would move each
frame's payload exclusion off the payload.

**The result is ADAPTED into `Repeater::Result`, not made first-class.** `Fuzz::Sender#send_ws`
synthesizes head = the handshake head (so `status` is the 101 and `--mh` works) and body = the
inbound DATA payloads concatenated, so `Fuzz::Matcher` needs no WebSocket branch and every
surface keeps working. Three exclusions from that body are load-bearing: outbound rows (else a
`--mr` naming the payload self-matches), CONTROL frames (a clean `1000 Normal` close was
appending `\x03\xE8` to every body until a spec caught it), and gori's own `[gori]` advisory
rows. `truncated` maps onto the existing `incomplete?` rather than inventing a second spelling,
and `timed_out` stays false because a WS drain ends on idle by design.

What the row gains is the pair a constant 101 cannot express — `ws_close_code` and
`ws_frames_in` — on the exact precedent of `grpc_status`/`grpc_message`, which exist because a
gRPC `:status` is 200 whether the call was granted or denied. Measured against a local origin
refusing quoted input: three payloads, three `101 · matched` rows, and `close 1000` / `close
1000` / `close 1008` as the only bit separating them.

**Refusals are `Fuzz::WsError < Gori::Error`, not new `PlanError::Reason` members.** That enum is
`case … in`-exhausted by three surfaces, one of which is the TUI Fuzzer tab — out of scope here,
and unable to produce a WebSocket refusal at all. Same argument `ChainError` already makes: a
refusal with no per-surface idiom ("`--race` is HTTP-only" reads identically everywhere) is
written once by the builder and carried by each surface's existing `Gori::Error` path. Only two
things are genuinely refused — `race_count`, and frames handed to a template with no `Upgrade:`
— plus `--http2` and `--record-history` at the surfaces. The merely INERT knobs
(`follow_redirects`, `timeout`, `auto_calibrate`) are reported through `Plan#ws_ignored_knobs`
instead: refusing a run over a flag that changes nothing is hostile, and staying silent is how an
operator comes to believe a sweep followed redirects it never followed.

`--record-history` is refused rather than faked. A recorded WS variation would be a flow whose
head declares `Upgrade: websocket` — so `FlowDetail#websocket?` answers true — carrying a 101
with a synthesized body no 101 has and ZERO `ws_messages` rows: it renders as a WebSocket with an
empty transcript, and re-seeding a repeater from it yields a session with no frames. The honest
version (the handshake as a flow PLUS the transcript through `insert_ws_messages`) needs
`Fuzz::Result` to retain the transcript under `keep_bodies`, which is a retention-budget change
of its own. The TUI Fuzzer tab stays HTTP-only for now, which is the one place this round leaves
the three surfaces short of parity.

### 2026-08-26: the active Scope lens follows flow selection into Comparer

Refines: [P4](#p4). PR #809.

Scope is a display lens rather than a capture boundary: out-of-scope flows remain canonical
project data, but a list used to select a flow should not immediately reveal rows the active lens
just hid in History and Sitemap. The Comparer picker therefore applies `Scope#filter` at its Store
query, before the 2,000-row limit. With the lens off, the filter is `QL::EMPTY` and the picker keeps
showing every captured flow.

The shared `FlowPicker` stays a presentation object over rows supplied by its caller. Applying the
lens at the Comparer open-site changes only that workflow; the entity-link picker keeps its own
unscoped row policy.

P4 is the reason the lens cannot be silent about it. A modal narrowed by a mode the modal never
mentions is a decision applied behind the operator's back, so the picker is TOLD its rows were
lensed and an all-hidden list reads `no flows in scope` (plus `⇧S toggles the lens`) rather than
`no flows captured yet` — the Sitemap's split, on a card that previously had no way to be wrong.
For the same reason the open-site passes `raise_on_error: true`: `Store#search` otherwise degrades
a SQLite failure to an empty result, which on this card is indistinguishable from an empty scope.

### 2026-08-26: upstream proxying is fail-closed for app-owned egress

Refines: [P1](#p1), [P4](#p4), [P5](#p5). #434.

`network.upstream_proxy` used to govern the proxy/send engines but not the updater or OAST's
stdlib HTTP clients. That made the setting read as a catch-all while two owned request paths
could still leave directly. The routing decision now stays in `Settings.upstream_route(host)`
and every app-owned socket, including those service clients, is opened by `Proxy::Upstream`.
An invalid declaration or a failed HTTP CONNECT/SOCKS handshake is a proxy error before any
origin socket; there is no direct retry. The existing blank project pin and ordered `direct`
rules remain explicit operator choices, not accidental fallbacks.

The scalar and ordered rules use the conventional SOCKS distinction uniformly: `socks5`
resolves destination names locally and sends an address literal, while `socks5h` sends RFC 1928
`ATYP DOMAIN` for proxy-side DNS. The local lookup is an intentional operator choice, visible in
both settings editors and the reference documentation rather than an implicit leak. Resolution
failure is a DNS error before the proxy socket is opened; there is still no direct retry. The
proxy endpoint itself is always resolved locally.

Project-scoped proxy authentication is one JSON value in the owner-only project DB, with the
method derived from the pinned route: HTTP Basic for an HTTP CONNECT proxy, RFC 1929 for
SOCKS5. Enabling it turns an inherited catch-all into an explicit project pin; otherwise a
later global edit or first-match rule could send the credential to a different proxy. A
malformed value or credentials without that pin is an invalid route for a matching
destination and fails before an origin socket. The Project editor shows the password only
while its row is focused and masks it again on leave; object inspection and status text remain redacted. Global rules retain
their environment-variable indirection so a shareable `settings.json` still contains no
proxy password.

`net.upstream_destination_host` is a project-only gate in front of the routing precedence.
Missing or `*` preserves the old proxy-all behaviour; a non-match is explicitly direct and
does not fall through to the global rule table or scalar. The same loader installs the gate
for TUI, headless and MCP surfaces, so every gori-owned dial receives the same answer.

### 2026-08-27: agent presence is a flock+sidecar marker, not a DB row

Refines: [P1](#p1), [P6](#p6). #815.

That a `gori mcp` server is attached to a project was recorded nowhere on disk. Three constraints
ruled out a DB heartbeat row: the project picker never opens project databases (it stats files),
a `--read-only` server cannot write one, and a periodic write moves `data_version` and makes every
watching TUI reload rules/scope/bindings on each beat. So presence is a per-process marker under
`<canonical db_path>.agents/`, held for the session with an exclusive flock — the same split as
`CaptureLock` + `CaptureStatus`: the flock is the truth about liveness (the kernel frees it on
SIGKILL, where no `ensure` runs) and the JSON body is decoration. Readers sweep any marker whose
lock they can take. The TUI polls the directory on the DV tick OUTSIDE `apply_external_change`,
because a marker moves no `data_version`.

### 2026-08-28: CVSS in issues — optional wire representation with live derivation

Refines: [P4](#p4), [P7](#p7). #575.

An issue finding can record an optional CVSS vector string or numeric score. This is NOT captured
wire, so P7's "keep the bytes as they arrived" does not apply to it: an operator's typing is the
input, and the standard already defines the canonical form of the thing they typed. `Store#insert_issue`
/ `#update_issues` normalise on the way in — the shard's canonical vector (metrics in spec order,
uppercase, every temporal/threat/environmental metric preserved) or a bare score unchanged — so two
operators filing the same finding, one pasting a scanner's lowercase form, leave ONE string in the
column. Every export prints it verbatim and anything downstream keys on it, so two spellings of one
vector is two values. Normalising at the write rather than in each surface that validates one is the
usual chokepoint argument: three validating surfaces are three places to forget.
A value that scores as nothing is kept exactly as given — the surfaces refuse to write new ones, so
anything unscorable reaching the store is legacy or imported, and NULLing it would lose data the write
was never asked to judge.
Verbatim is not the same as unchecked — every write path (TUI, `--cvss`, MCP `cvss`) REFUSES a string
that scores as nothing, because the column is read back through a parser and a value only its own raw
bytes can see is a field written on a command that reported success.
Severity (Info..Critical) is automatically derived from the score band whenever a valid CVSS vector or
score is supplied without an explicit override, across TUI, CLI (`--cvss`), and MCP (`cvss`).
Query filtering (`cvss:>=7.0`, `cvss:3.1`) resolves both numeric comparisons and vector substrings.

SARIF's per-rule `security-severity` folds each result to ONE number — a real CVSS score where the
issue carries one, its severity band's floor where it does not — and takes the maximum. Ranking the
score and the severity as two separate axes lets an unscored Critical be badged as its scored Low
sibling, which inverts the badge's whole promise ("the worst under this rule").

The operator-facing half is one input, not two. The issue form's `cvss` row is a LAUNCHER (`↵` opens
the calculator); the calculator holds the only editable copy of the value, as a `vector:` text field
above the metric rows that build one. Two editable copies of one value on two cards is how they
drift, and a form whose `↵` means "create" cannot also mean "open the builder". The calculator opens
on the LEAST severe vector it can spell, not the worst: a default that files a 9.8 Critical on a bare
`↵` puts a number in someone's report that nobody chose.

The builder writes v3.1 and v4.0, and treats them as SEPARATE ASSESSMENTS rather than two spellings of
one. v4.0 asks questions v3.1 does not (`AT`, and the Vulnerable/Subsequent impact split that replaces
`S`) and FIRST's own guidance is that the two do not convert, so the `version:` row translates nothing:
each version keeps its own selections while the card is open. A translated vector would put a score in
someone's report that nobody assessed. Any version the parser knows is still stored and scored as
typed — the builder is what is limited to two, not the field.

### 2026-08-28: a gRPC field position is a NAME, and a chain over it acts on the value

Refines: [P1](#p1), [P3](#p3), [P7](#p7). Extends the 2026-08-23 WebSocket entry (the composite
position space) and the 2026-08-17 gRPC-reframe entry. PR for #843.

The `.proto` lens landed in three parts and only two shipped: with a descriptor set loaded a
captured message renders as named, typed fields (#823) and the Repeater's `␣E` form edits one and
re-encodes (#837). Fuzzing one was missing, and the reason it could not simply be marked is the
whole design. A `§…§` position is a BYTE RANGE. The value of an `int32` field is the octets of a
varint, so marking one means wrapping markers around a wire encoding — and `-3` is ten
sign-extended octets as `int32`, one zigzagged octet as `sint32`, and something else again as a
`bool` or an enum. There is no payload an operator can write into that range that means anything.

**So the position is the DECLARATION, named rather than marked**: `--field role`, MCP `fields`,
the Fuzzer's **gRPC field(s)** row. The payload is TEXT and `Protobuf::Encoder` — the encoder
#837 specced against a reference-encoded message — decides the bytes. `Fuzz::GrpcFieldTemplate`
is a sibling of `Fuzz::WsScript` and makes the same argument it does: every attack mode, `--mark`,
each position's `¦chain`, `PayloadSet` and `AutoEncode` are defined over the payload-VALUE vector,
so a composite that concatenates its parts' position lists into one index space leaves `Mode`, the
generator's four mode methods and the payload layer untouched. The request's own `§…§` positions
are part 0 and the fields follow, which is what lets a Pitchfork lock a header to a typed field.

**Which fields exist, and which of them can carry a typed value, has ONE author** (P3):
`Protobuf::Lens.read` plus `Protobuf::Encoder.seed`, the same pair the `␣E` form reads its rows
through. #837 renders a field the schema does not declare, and one whose wire type the declaration
contradicts, as READ-ONLY, because re-encoding either would mean picking the schema over the
bytes — the guess the lens exists to avoid. The Fuzzer refuses them as positions for the same
reason and names it, and `^X` / a `§…§` over the octets remains the way to send what the schema
calls impossible. A second notion of "which field is this" is exactly what P3 forbids.

**Everything not fuzzed is COPIED** (P7). A variation is `Protobuf::Encoder.replace`-d out of the
capture's own octets once per field — a splice, not a serializer — so an undeclared field number,
a group, a non-minimal varint some other producer emitted and the unparsed tail of a truncated
capture all survive the whole run. Rendering every position with its own default reproduces the
seed request byte for byte, which is the property the run rests on rather than a nice-to-have.

**The 5-byte prefix follows the message here, and that does not weaken the 2026-08-17 default.**
That entry makes `--reframe-grpc` opt-in because a deliberately-wrong prefix is one of the
standard gRPC parser tests — and it is a statement about a payload spliced into BYTES. A field
position re-encodes the message through the schema at the operator's request, so a prefix
measuring the old length would make every request in the sweep a framing-layer rejection and
nothing else. It is `Proxy::H2::Grpc.frame`, the framer `␣F:FRAME` is built on, not a second one;
a frame whose flag byte carries anything but the compressed and trailer bits is refused rather
than normalized, because gori cannot re-emit it verbatim.

**A `¦chain`, `--encode` and the processor pipeline transform the TEXT, before the declared type
turns it into bytes.** The question is genuinely ambiguous and the other reading is not
defensible: what comes out of `Encoder.encode` is a tag plus a payload the declaration describes,
and base64-ing or hashing THAT yields octets no declaration describes, under a length prefix that
honestly measures garbage. It is also not a test anyone loses — byte-level mutation of a gRPC
body is what a `§…§` position over the same bytes already does. So the chain acts where the value
is still a value: `--field name¦base64-encode` sends the base64 of the payload AS that string, and
the same chain on an `int32` is refused up front, because base64 text is not an integer.

**Refusals arrive before the first dial** (the argument `refuse_unusable_chains` already makes for
a converter). Unlike a chain, "can this declaration hold this text" is answerable with no side
effect and no target, so the payload set is dry-run against the declaration at plan time — bounded,
because a payload set is not, with a render-time backstop that reports the reason on the row and
leaves the capture's octets in place rather than sending something else in silence.

The Miner is deliberately absent: hidden-parameter discovery over a typed schema is a different
question, since the schema already tells you the fields.

### 2026-08-29: the event log gets a human window, and stays one layer below the ring

Refines: [P4](#p4), [P8](#p8). Extends the #124 event-feed entry. Issue #864.

The `events` table records every agent mutation and send, and `log_agent_action`'s own comment
says why: so the AI's activity is *"visible to the human (and tailable via `list_events`)"*. Only
the second half was built. `events_after` served the MCP tool and nothing in `src/gori/tui/` had
ever named the table, so the audit record P4 rests on — the human can see what was decided on
their project — was readable only by the process being audited. The Project tab's ACTIVITY pane
is the missing reader, and the interesting decisions are about what it must NOT become.

**It is a query, not a queue** (P8). A filter bar over a bounded page, the way History is a query
over flows: no inbox, no unread badge, no ranking, and nothing is pushed. Which settles the
question the notification ring raises by existing. `[event log] --(promotion policy)-->
[notification ring]` is a layering, and the two ends differ by orders of magnitude — the ring
holds a hundred notes in memory and dies with the project; the log holds fifty thousand rows on
disk and is the record. Merging them would either drown the interrupt channel or truncate the
record, so this change moves nothing between them: the promotion policy is untouched, no event
becomes a notification, and the pane pushes nothing back.

**A narrowed list narrows in SQL, and then must be bounded — at the retention cap, not below it.**
`list_events` selects `source`/`kind` in Crystal after fetching its page, which is right for a
forward cursor whose `next_cursor` is the max SCANNED id, and wrong for a screenful: a
`source:bindings` chip over a feed of agent rows would hand the operator an empty pane while the
matches sat two pages down. So `events_recent` puts every narrowing in the WHERE — and nothing
indexes `events`, so a predicate matching nothing cannot short-circuit on the LIMIT and scans
until the table runs out, on the fiber that paints the screen.

`recent_agent_actions` met this first and answered with an id floor at `MAX(id) - 5000`. Copying
that constant here was the plan and the measurement refused it: on a full 50k-row feed the
filtered backwards scan answers in **~0.9 ms**, and the windowed form measured *slower* once its
extra `MAX/MIN` lookup was counted. A tighter window buys no time and costs correctness — every
match below it renders as "no events match", a false statement about the operator's own project,
which is the [absence-reads-as-clean](#p4) failure in its purest form. So the window is
`@events_retention` itself: in a store being trimmed the whole feed is inside one window and the
bound can never truncate, while a store that is *not* being trimmed is still bounded.
That store is reachable — `trim_events` runs off FLOW inserts, so an MCP-only process that writes
events and captures nothing grows the table past its cap — and there the pane says
"in the newest N events" rather than claiming nothing matched. The bound and the sentence that
describes it are one decision; a bound whose truncation is invisible is worse than none.
`next_before` carries the same distinction: it names the window edge, not nil, when the window
rather than the feed ran out.

**Absence has two meanings and the pane must not confuse them.** `rows.empty?` means "nothing has
happened" only while nothing is narrowing the list; the moment a chip is on it means "your filter
is hiding it", and the two send the operator in opposite directions. The pane asks the feed
separately, and says the two things in different words — the same discipline History keeps with
`@no_flows`. For the same reason `events_recent` does not rescue to `[]`: `recent_agent_actions`
may, because it garnishes a notification that goes out either way, but here the rows ARE the
answer and a swallowed error rendered as "no activity" is the one reading that tells someone to
stop looking.

**The cursor is an event id.** The list is newest-first and PREPENDS, and an attached agent writes
into it while the operator reads. A row-index cursor slides onto a neighbour the moment that
happens, so `↵` acts on an event nobody selected — the failure `NotificationsOverlay#index_in`
documents. `id` is `AUTOINCREMENT` and never reused, which is what makes it the anchor.

**`↵` honours the producer's declared target rather than guessing.** A row carrying `goto_tab`
chose that tab when it was written — Probe's H3 notice names the Probe tab even though it also
carries a flow — so the declaration wins and `flow_id` is the fallback, which is what makes the
binding failures (the rows that carry only a flow) open the exchange that explains them. The
resolution is a pure function of the row, so an unknown `goto_tab` resolves to nothing rather
than to a Symbol no tab answers to: the feed is written by other processes and outlives any one
build's tab catalog.

**Out of scope, deliberately: any new event producer.** A silent failure that is not in the feed
yet is a one-line `insert_event` in its own change. This one surfaces what was already written —
including the level the feed spells two ways, `"warn"` everywhere and `"warning"` from the
Sequencer, which the filter matches as a set because rows already on disk cannot be respelled.

**The feed had to learn WHO, and the answer already existed.** The first cut recorded what agents
and engines did; a scope rule the operator edited in the TUI and one an agent rewrote through MCP
were indistinguishable, on the one surface whose job is telling them apart. `flows` had answered
the same question since #770 — `source_surface`, spelling it `tui`/`cli`/`mcp` — so `events.actor`
takes those three words rather than minting a second vocabulary for one axis ([P3](#p3)). It is
ambient (`FlowSource.surface`, set once per entry point) and not threaded through, because the
config seam below is shared by all three surfaces and 26 `Scope.load` sites deep: an argument
would have to be carried through five model APIs to arrive somewhere the caller already knew. One
process is one surface, so there is nothing for two callers to disagree about. NULL stays a real
answer — a row from before the column, or an engine acting on nobody's behalf — because a default
would make every un-updated path claim to be a surface it is not.

**Config changes are recorded at the MODEL, not at the surfaces.** `Scope#add`,
`HostOverrides#update`, `Rules#toggle` and `Env.save_project` are what all three surfaces reach,
so one site per change covers TUI, CLI and MCP at once. Recording per surface would be three
copies of each, and the CLI is reliably the copy that gets forgotten — the same argument
`apply_external_change` makes for reloading models rather than views. The gate is the store's own
answer: every one of these returns whether the write COMMITTED (several had to be fixed to, in
earlier entries), and an attempt recorded as a change would put a rule in the audit trail that
never gated a request.

**An audit line must not leak what it exists to protect.** `$KEY` vars are the one config surface
whose content is secret by default, so the line carries NAMES and a count and never a value; an
upstream proxy URL has its userinfo redacted, and the scrubber stays inside the AUTHORITY —
reaching past it turned `http://corp.example/a@b` into `http://••••@b`, erasing the host the line
exists to record. A rewrite rule is named by its match and never by its replacement, which is the
half an operator pastes a token into.

**An MCP-driven change is recorded twice, deliberately.** `log_agent_action` writes the call and
its outcome (including the refusals a config event never sees); the config event writes the value
the tool name cannot carry. Two questions, two rows, one `actor`, separated by the source chip —
a single row would have to drop one of the halves.

### 2026-09-02: a denied baseline anchors nothing, and `Same` must not read as a bypass

Refines: [P4](#p4). Extends the 2026-08-16 Authorize entry.

That entry drew the line at traffic that never left: a run whose sends were all refused reports
`nothing_sent`, never `enforced`, because the shape of "we learned nothing" is indistinguishable
from the shape of "the server held". The same substitution reaches the *other* headline through a
door that entry did not cover.

Authorize's finding is `Same` — a non-baseline identity was served what the baseline was served —
and every surface aggregates a row holding one to BYPASS. The word claims the identity under test
obtained the protected resource. It cannot be true when the BASELINE got a 4xx or a 5xx: the
privileged request this run is anchored on was refused too, so a matching denial is two refusals
and evidence of nothing. In practice that covered the most ordinary inputs the tool has — a
captured flow that 403s, any 404 in a `--query` selection, and the case an operator hits weekly, a
baseline slot whose session cookie has expired, which painted every request in the run red.

So `Judge.verdict` returns `Review` against a denied baseline, in the same position and for the
same stated reason as the `baseline.error` guard immediately above it: a baseline that cannot
anchor a comparison must not have one asserted against it. `Review` is the verdict whose whole
meaning is "the operator judges", the row keeps both statuses on screen, and no finding is lost —
a 4xx/5xx baseline can never have been served the resource, so there was no bypass under it to
miss. The demotion is stated rather than left to be inferred (`Target#baseline_denied?`): a CLI
note per request plus a run tally, MCP's `baseline_denied_count` and a per-result field, and the
TUI's run summary — because a row that quietly stops being red is the same silence this section
keeps refusing.

A 3xx baseline is deliberately NOT included. `302 → /login` is a denial and `302 → /dashboard` is
a grant, and only the `Location` separates them, which is exactly what `redirect_verdict` reads.

### 2026-09-03: `verbatim` is literalness, and it reaches the send seam

Refines: [P4](#p4), [P7](#p7). Issue #910.

`Plan.expand_requests` deliberately leaves a DECLARED session binding for the send seam, so that
a Repeater tab carrying `Authorization: Bearer $SESSION` picks up the live identity on every send
instead of freezing whichever value was held when the tab was built. `verbatim` is the operator
saying, about the same kind of draft, that these bytes ARE the message. The two intentions
genuinely collide, and the collision was being resolved silently in favour of the binding: every
verbatim surface set the BUILDER flag (`expand_request: false`) and nothing else, so a stored
`GET /api?$TOKEN=1` left for the origin as `GET /api?SECRETTOKEN123=1` under a flag whose help
text reads "no `$VAR` expansion". That is a request nobody wrote, and it puts a live credential in
the position the operator chose as a PAYLOAD and into the target's access log.

The operator's word wins, on a field of its own. `PlanOptions#expand_bindings?` (default on) is
carried into `Repeater::Sender`, which ANDs it with `evidence?` once — `resolve_bindings?` — and
every site that reaches the `$NAME` pass asks that one predicate. NOT `evidence: verbatim`, which
reaches the same seam and works: `evidence?` is PROVENANCE, a `--verbatim` send is the operator's
own draft, and spending the provenance word on literalness would make every later reader of it
wrong about who wrote the bytes. (`Fuzz::Sender` does spell this `evidence`, and that is not
drift — there it is *defined* as the maximal verbatim span, so the two words already name one
thing on that side of the tree.)

The flag is set on all three surfaces in one change — `gori run repeater send --verbatim`, MCP
`send_request{raw|repeater_id, verbatim}` — plus the WebSocket handshake head and its frames, and
a spec drives each through its own glue rather than through a hand-built `PlanOptions`. This seam
had already drifted between exactly these surfaces twice, both times because one of them was
edited alone.

The scope gate moves with the pass, and that is the half worth naming: `Sender#refusal` derives
its URL from the bytes AFTER the binding pass, so switching the pass off in `wire` alone would ask
the Sandbox about `/api?SECRETTOKEN123=1` and then put `/api?$TOKEN=1` on the wire — one
path-scoped rule away from a decision taken about a URL that never existed. `send_ws` carried its
own copy of `wire`'s two lines and that copy expanded unconditionally, so the handshake of a
WS tab seeded from a capture was expanding where the HTTP path had stopped; it now goes through
`wire`, and the TUI names the withheld tokens on the WS status line the way the HTTP one already
did — [P4](#p4) is why the suppression is stated rather than merely done.

Making the two agree meant making the gate read `wire`'s OUTPUT rather than deciding a second
time. `send_wire` re-ran the binding pass over bytes already through it, asserting in its own
comment that this was a no-op; it is not, because the pass also CONSUMES the `$$` escape, so the
second run resolved the `$TOKEN` the first run produced from `$$TOKEN`. `refusal_wired` is now the
single implementation of "may these bytes go out" and every send site hands it the final slice —
which also takes a send-group from 2N full-message passes to N. Two consequences are worth
stating rather than leaving to be discovered: under `verbatim` NOTHING interprets the `$` grammar,
so `$$name` is no longer consumed either (write `$name` — it cannot resolve there anyway); and
this is LAYER 2 only. Layer 1 (`request_scope_url`, `repeater_scope_verdict`) still reads the
pre-seam draft, so a send that does expand is asked about two different targets by the two layers.
That is older and wider than this seam — it asks whether an include list should be matched against
a live credential at all — and `verbatim` narrows it, since with the pass off both layers read one
URL.

The SESSION SLOT overlay is deliberately NOT switched off with it, and the answer is stated rather
than inherited. `verbatim` says which BYTES; a slot says WHOSE identity, and an operator asks both
in one command (`--slot admin --verbatim`). Letting the byte answer veto the identity one would
send that command as the stored identity while the operator named another — a silent substitution
in the one direction [P4](#p4) refuses. The no-overlay answer already has a name and it is
`as-captured`. A `$NAME` in a slot's own header value is the one `$NAME` in gori guaranteed to be
a reference and never a payload, so resolving it takes nothing literal away from the operator's
bytes.

### 2026-09-04: TLS to an upstream proxy is a new scheme, and the proxy leg has its own trust

Refines: [P0](#p0), [P4](#p4), [P5](#p5). Issue #3.

An upstream HTTP CONNECT proxy could only be reached in cleartext. `https://` in
`network.upstream_proxy` was already accepted and already meant *the plaintext form* — a
compatibility reading that predates gori speaking TLS to a proxy at all.

**The scheme was not reclaimed.** Redefining `https://` would have moved every existing
operator's egress onto a ClientHello their proxy may not answer, on upgrade, with no edit — the
one shape [P4](#p4) refuses. So `https://` keeps its meaning byte-for-byte and
`Settings::UPSTREAM_TLS_KIND` (`http+tls`) is the new spelling, used as BOTH the rule `kind` and
the URI scheme because those two grammars name one transport and a second word for it is how
they drift. The ambiguity is *reported* rather than enforced: `upstream_proxy_advisory` names
both fixes, `upstream_proxy_warnings` emits it at the two sites `outbound_tls_warnings` already
uses, and editing the split proxy fields in either settings editor normalizes the stored value
to `http://` on save. An untouched value is never rewritten. A portless `http+tls` address
defaults to 443, not 8080: falling back to the plaintext default would dial the cleartext
listener of the same appliance.

**The proxy leg's trust policy is separate from the origin's, and that separation is the
feature.** `network.upstream_proxy_ca` and `network.upstream_proxy_insecure` govern it;
`verify_upstream` / `--insecure-upstream` and the `outbound_tls` table do not, and cannot.
`-k` is a statement about one broken origin, and letting it also stop authenticating the proxy
that carries every session would disarm the one hop the operator did not choose to inspect.
Mechanically the two are separate SSL_CTX caches — the origin's key is
`{verify, alpn, outbound-TLS policy}`, all three of which belong to the destination, so sharing
it would present an origin's client certificate to the proxy and offer `h2` on a leg that only
ever speaks an HTTP/1.1 CONNECT. SNI and the verified name are the PROXY's own hostname, never
the origin's and never a hostname override: an override is a resolver override for the
destination an operator names in a request, and applying it to the proxy would let one table row
redirect the hop carrying the credential. A rejected proxy certificate says so in the proxy's
terms and explicitly declines to offer `--insecure-upstream` as the fix.

**The TLS wrap happens before any request byte.** `CONNECT` names the origin and
`Proxy-Authorization` is a reusable credential; in the plaintext form both are readable by
anything on the path to the proxy. `dial_via_proxy` therefore wraps first and writes second, and
the spec asserts this from the fixture's side — the proxy reports only what it read *after* the
handshake. An `https://` origin through such a proxy is TLS inside TLS, and the origin's
certificate is still verified end to end under its own policy.

**Every dial entry point now returns `IO?`.** `Upstream.dial`/`dial_result` handed back a
`TCPSocket?`, which cannot represent a TLS socket to a proxy. Widening it was mechanical
everywhere except `HttpTransport.wrap_tls`, because the proxy, Repeater, Fuzzer and Miner paths
already read and wrote an `IO` — the h1/h2/WS engines and `ConnPool` were typed that way from
the start. Close ownership stays exact: the TLS wrapper takes `sync_close: true`, so closing the
returned socket closes the descriptor, and `close_proxy_leg` covers the window between the
connect and the wrap where the constructor has raised and nothing else owns the fd
(`Socket::Client.new` frees the SSL object but does not close the io it was handed).

Per-rule TLS fields were deliberately not added ([P0](#p0)): one policy covers every `http+tls`
hop today, and a second TLS proxy with a different trust anchor is what should force the table
column.

### 2026-09-04: RFC 8441 replaces the handshake, so the transport is an `IO` and not a second engine

Refines: [P1](#p1), [P7](#p7). Issue #733.

gori captured a WebSocket opened over HTTP/2 and could not re-open one. The gap was never the
frames — RFC 8441 §5.1 replaces the WebSocket HANDSHAKE and nothing else, so an h2 socket carries
the byte-identical RFC 6455 frames an HTTP/1.1 one carries, and `H2::WsCapture` already read them
with the same codec the h1 relay runs. What was missing was a way to OPEN the socket, and every
surface said so in its own words: three seeds refused, `gori run repeater <flow-id>` sent the
operator to a session route that also refused, and the TUI handed over a plain HTTP tab plus a
status line explaining what it was not carrying.

The seam is an `IO`. `Repeater::H2WsStream` does the extended CONNECT and then presents that
stream's DATA payloads as a byte stream, and `WsEngine`'s scripted exchange — `run_session` →
`exchange` → `drain` → `finish` — runs over it unchanged. A second engine would have meant a
second `DrainState`, a second set of the three §5.4 reassembly moments, a second answer to "did
the peer close", and a second copy of five capture caps, for a protocol whose frames do not differ
at all ([P1](#p1)). The capture side had already drawn this line for the same reason: `WsCapture`
is a reassembler over one codec, not a second parser.

The accounting is borrowed, not re-derived. `H2Engine::SendFlow`, `apply_settings`, `credit`,
`write_header_block`, `window_update`, `ack`, `goaway_reason`, `rst_reason` and the two frame
strippers went public for this, the way `exchange` went public for `H2Pool`. A flow-control window
kept in two places is how the halves of one connection start disagreeing, and `H2Engine`'s own
history has three defects of exactly that shape recorded in its comments.

The BYTES pick the transport, never a flag. An extended CONNECT head and an `Upgrade:` head are
two handshakes for one protocol, and the capture says which it was: `Proxy::WS.extended_connect_request?`
reads the `CONNECT` line plus the `X-Gori-Protocol` marker that `HeadCodec.synth_request` writes
for the `:protocol` pseudo-header, and `WsEngine.send` branches on it. This is the rule
`Repeater::Plan` already followed in picking `WsEngine` over `Engine` — it reads the FINAL wire,
not the stored text — and it is what keeps a surface from being able to disagree with the request
it is about to send. `WsEngine.replayable?` is the one predicate every seed, gate and engine choice
asks; `upgrade_request?` stays the h1 half alone, because it is also what selects the h1 dial.

Nothing is invented ([P7](#p7)). `:protocol` comes from the head's own marker line, which
`H2Engine.parse_request` now folds back into the pseudo-header it was projected from — the exact
inverse of the synthesis, and the fix for a captured extended CONNECT that used to go out as an
ordinary h2 request carrying gori's diagnostic line as a regular field. `:method` and `:path` are
the request line's, and a header the operator kept is a header the origin sees. An h1 handshake is
not fabricated so that the seed can dial, which was the refusal's own argument and remains right.

Every way this fails is REPORTED, because the failure mode a replay path must not have is looking
like a clean run with an empty transcript. An origin that does not advertise
SETTINGS_ENABLE_CONNECT_PROTOCOL is a refusal naming the setting — RFC 8441 §3 forbids sending the
stream without it, so gori does not try and see. A non-2xx is a refusal carrying the origin's own
head, so `answered?` is true exactly as it is for a 403 to an h1 upgrade. A RST_STREAM, a GOAWAY
or a send window that never reopens raises `IO::Error` carrying the peer's stated reason, which
the drain already turns into `DrainState#gone_reason` and from there into the result's note, with
the frames already exchanged kept. And `keep_key` says it has nothing to keep rather than being
ignored: §5.1 carries no `Sec-WebSocket-Key`.

One knob's meaning narrows. `--http2` + a WebSocket script was refused outright; it is now refused
only against an `Upgrade:` handshake, since HTTP/2 has no upgrade mechanism (RFC 9113 §8.1) and an
extended CONNECT IS the h2 form — where `http2` is true by construction from the seed. The
`ws_http_only` / `^V` escape hatch has two stops rather than three on such a tab: WebSocket, or
the CONNECT as a plain h2 request. There is no HTTP/1.1 form of those bytes, and offering one
would have sent `CONNECT /chat` down an h1 socket, where it names a host and not a path.

Out of scope, deliberately: HTTP/3, and Match & Replace or per-message intercept on an h2 socket.
Those two still need a length-CHANGING DATA rewrite, which is what #492 step 5 was closed over,
and the capture advisory keeps saying so.
