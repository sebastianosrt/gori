# DESIGN.md: gori architecture and principles

gori's source comments cite this file two ways: by principle (`(P4)`, `(P6/P7)`) and by
section (`DESIGN.md §4`). Both are load-bearing shorthand: roughly 120 principle citations
across 49 files, so the numbering here is stable. Sections keep their numbers and
principles keep their labels even when the prose around them is rewritten.

Anchor convention: every section carries an explicit `<a id="sN">` and every principle an
`<a id="pN">`, so `DESIGN.md#s4` and `DESIGN.md#p7` keep resolving no matter how a heading
is later reworded.

This document describes what the code does today, reconstructed from the code and its
comments. Where a principle and the code disagree, one of the two is a bug: record which
in [§7](#s7) rather than quietly widening the principle to fit.

<a id="s1"></a>

## §1 Principles (P0 to P8)

Each principle is one rule plus where to go read it in the tree.

<a id="p0"></a>

### P0: Minimal

Do not build a hierarchy or an abstraction speculatively; add structure when a concrete
second caller forces it, not before.

`src/gori.cr` defines a single `Gori::Error` base and subtypes only when a `rescue` has to
discriminate. `src/gori/tui/screen.cr` keeps `Screen` to the primitives gori's own chrome
needs, "minimal, grow-as-needed widgets" ([§5](#s5)).

<a id="p1"></a>

### P1: One execution path

A feature is declared once and gets no private dispatch path.

A `Verb::Definition` (`src/gori/verb.cr`) is the one source of truth for a keybinding, a
command-palette entry, and a space-menu entry; all three run the same `#call`. Bindings are
declared only in `src/gori/verb/keymap.cr`, and `src/gori/tui/palette.cr` and
`src/gori/tui/space_menu.cr` both go through the registry rather than re-implementing the
action.

Reach: P1 holds inside the TUI. The `gori run` CLI and the `gori mcp` server do not read the
verb registry; they reach feature parity by calling the same engines ([§2](#s2)), which is a
convention rather than a shared code path. That gap is real, known, and under decision in
issue #357.

**The space menu is one menu per tab, not one per focus level.** `Verb::Definition#section`
is a FOCUS-AREA axis, and for a long time it gated visibility straight through: the card was
`COMMON ∪ the focused pane's section`, so the sub-tab strip's own verbs — new, close,
duplicate, rename, mark, find, filter — showed only while the strip had focus. From a body pane
the operator had to walk focus up a level before `Space` would offer to close the sub-tab
they were looking at. With `⇧1`–`⇧9` landing anywhere on the strip, *what `Space` offers must
not depend on which row the cursor happens to be on*. So on the nine tabs that carry a strip
(Repeater, Fuzzer, Miner, Sequencer, Decoder, JWT, Cookie, Comparer, Notes) the `:subtab` and
`:tab` sections are drawn as one `SUB-TABS` bucket on **every** view: expanded where the strip
or the tab bar has focus, and one `T` **Sub-tabs…** row in a pane (§7, 2026-09-25). The two
sections were always the same idea (the strip's actions, and the strip's search/filter); only
the focus level that revealed them differed.

**The bucket spells an intent with the same letter on all nine strips** — `n` new, `w` close,
`d` duplicate, `e` rename, `t` mark, `f` find, `/` filter, `T` mark-all, `N` clear-marks (the
Repeater adds `g` tag) — and a tab that lacks an intent omits the row rather than spending the
letter elsewhere. That is what makes it one table to learn instead of nine, and it is the
reason the bucket is worth a rule of its own: the nine are reserved in COMMON, which shares the
strip-focused card, and a pane view reserves only `T`.

**When a letter collides, the PANE mnemonic moves, not the strip's.** A strip letter has to
read the same on all nine strips, so moving it costs nine tabs to save one pane; a pane letter
costs exactly one pane. The exception is a pane letter that is the tab's primary verb — which
is why rename is `e` and not `r`: `r` is Send/Run (with `Ctrl-R` beside it) in four of the
nine, and no uniform strip letter is worth taking the key those tabs exist for.
`Registry#validate_menu_keys!` sweeps the merged views at build time, so a collision is a
boot-time raise rather than a silently unreachable row.

<a id="p2"></a>

### P2: not assigned

There is no P2. The label has never been used in the tree, and `CSP2` in
`src/gori/probe/passive/security_headers.cr` is a Content-Security-Policy version, not a
principle. It is left vacant rather than closed up; see [Numbering](#numbering).

<a id="p3"></a>

### P3: No premature generalization of data

Model what the traffic actually contains. Collapsing it into templates is an explicit,
reversible view choice, never a parse-time assumption.

`src/gori/sitemap.cr` gives every distinct URL segment its own node, and only then folds
numeric runs and opaque ids into `{uuid}` / `{hex}` / `{date}` group nodes, above an explicit
threshold, keeping the real children underneath. Folding happens when the tree is built;
the stored rows keep the URL exactly as captured.

<a id="p4"></a>

### P4: The human decides

Holding, editing, dropping, rewriting, and active probing are operator decisions, made
explicitly and auditably, never inferred or auto-applied behind the operator's back.

`src/gori/interceptor.cr` and `src/gori/tui/runner.cr` hold an in-flight message
*indefinitely* for a forward / edit / drop decision; the only timeout is an opt-in guard for
an attached agent, and with no agent ever attached the hold stays indefinite.
`src/gori/rules.cr` (match&replace) is human-configured and persisted per project. Scope,
sandbox, and the active-scan gates are all explicit ([§3](#s3)).

<a id="p5"></a>

### P5: Mediated state

Mutable state is reached only through a narrow facade; nothing reaches across into another
component's raw state.

Verbs get `Verb::ExecContext` (`src/gori/verb/context.cr`) and never touch TUI, proxy, or
store state directly. Tab controllers get `Host` (`src/gori/tui/tab_controller.cr`) and never
call another controller or `Runner`. The Store writer fiber fires replies and events only
*after* commit, so nothing observes uncommitted rows (`src/gori/store.cr`). Project state is
isolated per project DB (`src/gori/project.cr`).

<a id="p6"></a>

### P6: Never stall the data path

The proxy and the Store writer are hot paths; persistence and analysis happen off the
critical path.

`src/gori/store.cr` batches a burst of writes into one transaction to amortize fsync.
`src/gori/proxy/server.cr` and `src/gori/proxy/upstream.cr` set `sync = true` so writes go out
immediately. `src/gori/proxy/head_rewriter.cr` rewrites the head while the body streams
untouched, and body rewrites are opt-in precisely because they cost the zero-buffer path
(`src/gori/proxy/codec/body.cr` streams with `max_bytes` at `Int64::MAX` when forwarding).

<a id="p7"></a>

### P7: Raw bytes are the truth

The captured wire bytes are canonical. Pretty views, decodes, and highlights are derived and
display-only, and a message the codec cannot fully parse still yields its octets.

`src/gori/proxy/codec/http1.cr` never rejects malformed input on capture or replay, only on
the live MITM path where forwarding it would be ambiguous. `src/gori/pretty.cr` never mutates
the input slice. `src/gori/store/models.cr` stores head and body as byte-exact wire octets,
with the parsed columns as a queryable projection. The h2 raw frame log and the WS raw frames
stay the truth even when the assembled view is incomplete.

<a id="p8"></a>

### P8: Pull, not push

There is no queue, inbox, or ranking. You *find* things with a query, and per-row signals are
computed only when a row is on screen.

`src/gori/tui/history_view.cr` is a flat append-only log with a QL bar (`/`) as the only
navigation. `src/gori/store/reads.cr` fetches a flow's passive-signal tags lazily, per
on-screen row. `src/gori/ql.cr` is the analysis surface ([§4](#s4)).

<a id="numbering"></a>

### Numbering

The set is deliberately not contiguous. P2 stays vacant.

Renumbering was considered and rejected: the labels carry roughly 120 citations across 49
source files, so closing the hole would invalidate every citation for a cosmetic gain, and
any comment missed in that commit would silently start asserting a different principle. A
future principle should take P9 rather than fill P2.

P0, P1, P4, P5, P6, P7, and P8 are cited inline in `src/`. P3 is cited once, in
`src/gori/sitemap.cr`.

## §2 Architecture and data flow

```
client ──▶ Proxy (proxy/) ──▶ target
             │  scope + sandbox gate, intercept (P4), match&replace, host overrides
             ▼
          Store (store.cr)          single writer fiber + Channel (P6)
             │  flows / ws messages / h2 frames / sse events / issues / notes / sessions
             ▼
   ┌─────────┴───────────┬─────────────────────┐
  TUI (tui/)          CLI (cli/run.cr)      MCP (mcp/tools.cr)
  verbs + tabs        `gori run ...`        agent tools
```

Three surfaces, one engine layer. The TUI, the `gori run` CLI, and the `gori mcp` server all
build on the same lower-level engines (`Repeater::*`, `Fuzz`, `Miner`, `Sequencer`,
`Discover`, `Probe`, `QL`, `Store`). They do **not** share a dispatcher. Surface parity
("every action is also a CLI subcommand and an MCP tool") is a convention, held by each
surface calling the shared engines rather than by one code path. Keeping the surfaces thin
over fat shared engines is what makes that convention cheap to hold, and every parity gap
found so far has been in the surface layer, not the engines.

Concurrency: gori runs on Crystal's cooperative fiber scheduler, never `-Dpreview_mt`.
`Store` funnels all writes through one fiber fed by a buffered `Channel`; reads use the WAL
connection pool directly. `Scope`, `Rules`, `HostOverrides`, and `Interceptor` each guard an
in-memory snapshot with a `Mutex`, and `Rules` and `Interceptor` additionally keep a lock-free
`Atomic` counter so the common no-op case on the proxy hot path takes no lock at all.
Cross-*process* coordination (a second `gori mcp` process driving intercept decisions, or
capture ownership of a project) goes through the flock-based `CaptureLock`/`OpenLock` and
Store bridge tables, not shared memory. Live in-memory objects on the proxy path
(`Rules`, `Bindings`, `Probe::Analyzer` mode, `Scope`, `HostOverrides`) are re-read from
the store — and the global rewriter/colormarker sections from settings.json — on the
capturer's `data_version` tick / headless reload loop. An exclusive `OpenLock` (Compact,
project delete) makes a peer `Store.open` fail rather than proceed unannounced.

<a id="s2-1"></a>

### §2.1 Layering contract

Core subsystems do not know that a surface exists. `store/`, `proxy/`, `probe/`, `fuzz/`,
`miner/`, `discover/`, `sequencer/`, and `oast/` must not reference `Tui::`, `CLI::`, or
`MCP::` in code. Enforced by `spec/layering_spec.cr`; the same set is checkable by hand:

```sh
grep -rnE '\b(Tui|CLI|MCP)::' \
  src/gori/{store,proxy,probe,fuzz,miner,discover,sequencer,oast,authorize}/ \
  src/gori/{store,probe,fuzz,miner,discover,sequencer,oast,authorize}.cr
```

(There is no `src/gori/proxy.cr`; the proxy is directory-only.) A comment may point at a
caller; code may not — so the assertion is that **every hit is a comment line**, not that
there are N of them. The count is not the check precisely because it moves whenever one of
those comments is reworded: this paragraph claimed "exactly one hit" for long enough that
the true figure reached twelve across four files, which is the failure mode the spec exists
to remove.

Dependencies run one way. Surfaces depend on engines, engines depend on `Store` and the
codecs, and nothing depends on a surface. `src/gori/sitemap.cr` and `src/gori/notes.cr` are
the pattern to copy: the data model and the pure algorithms live in a surface-free module,
and `Tui::SitemapView` and `gori run sitemap` are thin layers over it, which is why the CLI
report and the interactive tab cannot drift apart.

One caveat worth naming: the CLI reaches into `MCP::Serialize` for JSON output
(`src/gori/cli/run/intercept.cr`, `src/gori/cli/run/history.cr`). That is surface to surface,
not core to surface, so it does not breach the rule above, but the shared JSON shape should
move to a neutral module the day a third caller needs it (P0: when the second caller forces
it, and it now has).

<a id="s3"></a>

## §3 Scope

Cited from `src/gori/scope.cr`.

Scope is an ordered include/exclude rule set evaluated over `scheme://host/target`. A rule has
a kind (include or exclude) and a match type: `host` (exact, subdomain, or `*` glob,
case-insensitive), `string` (case-insensitive substring), or `regex` (case-sensitive).

It has three distinct jobs, and conflating them is the usual source of bugs:

1. **Display lens.** Everything is captured regardless. When scope is enabled, History,
   Sitemap, and the Comparer flow picker show only in-scope flows; History and Sitemap retain
   their inline scope markers.
2. **Intercept gate.** Out-of-scope flows are not held for a decision.
3. **Sandbox: a hard containment gate.** When on, a request to a host that is not allowlisted
   is blocked outright and still recorded, so the operator sees the blocked attempt (P4/P7).
   A scope with no include rules blocks everything rather than allowing everything: the gate
   fails closed, on purpose, and `Probe::Active` shares that same decision.

Rules live in the Store and are mirrored into an in-memory `Scope` snapshot read on the proxy
hot path; SQL-side and in-memory evaluation are deliberately kept in parity so a query and the
live gate can never disagree.

Active traffic (repeater, fuzz, mine, sequence, discover, active probe) is gated on the same
rule set, through one chokepoint: `Gori::Outbound` (`src/gori/outbound.cr`). The active senders
`Fuzz::Sender` and `Repeater::Sender` take it as a **constructor argument**, so an ungated
sender does not compile (P5). It carries two layers:

- **Layer 1**, before side effects: the include/allowlist decision. Its strictness is the only
  thing that legitimately varies per surface, and the variants are named rather than
  re-derived at each call site: `Outbound.agent` (MCP, refusing anything not included,
  including an unconfigured project), `Outbound.cli` (`gori run`, where an unconfigured
  project stays permissive), `Outbound.interactive` (TUI, no up-front gate because the
  operator typed the target). A Repeater send is judged on its binding-expanded
  request-target (`Plan#scope_requests`), and the sender asks again on the real wire.
- **Layer 2**, per send: Sandbox mode always, plus explicit EXCLUDE rules for an automated
  sweep. Identical on every surface, and applied even when Layer 1 was waived.

Both layers judge the URL anchored on the host actually being **dialled**, not the one in the
request line (`Outbound.scope_url`). A refusal never prints an expanded target, which may
carry a live credential. A raw request may deliberately carry an absolute-form
request line pointing somewhere else, which is a legitimate Host-header, cache-poisoning, or
SSRF test and still goes out verbatim (P7); scoping on that spoofed host would let an anchored
include rule authorise a send to a different origin.

Waiving Layer 1 is only reachable through `--allow-unscoped` / `allow_unscoped:true`, or a
genuinely absent project. Either way the result is a named `Unscoped(reason)` that shows up in
the audit line, never a nil that silently skips the gate.

<a id="s4"></a>

## §4 Query language (QL)

Cited from `src/gori/ql.cr`.

QL is a Lucene/KQL-style boolean filter over captured flows: bare terms for free text,
`field:value` predicates, `~`-prefixed regex, and `AND` / `OR` / `NOT` / grouping.

- `:` fields: `host` `path` `method` `scheme` `proto` `status` `size` `reqsize` `respsize`
  `dur` `header` `body`
- `~` regex on: `host` `path` `url` `header` `body`
- comparison ops (`<=` `>=` `<` `>` `=`) apply to `status`, `size`, `reqsize`, `respsize`,
  `dur`

It compiles to a SQL `WHERE` fragment plus bound params. Values are always parameterised,
never interpolated, so the projection columns stay injection-safe. Regex terms are evaluated
by the `Gori::SafeRegexp` function that `Store` installs into the connection
(`SafeRegexp.install`, `src/gori/store.cr`), so an invalid pattern or a byte-unsafe body
fails closed rather than crashing the scan.

QL is the only way you navigate History, because there is no queue and no ranking (P8). One
grammar backs all of it: the History `/` filter bar, `gori run history`, the MCP
`list_history` and `ql_*` tools, and the other filter surfaces built on `filter_ast.cr`.

<a id="s5"></a>

## §5 Rendering and chrome

Cited from `src/gori/tui/screen.cr`.

The TUI builds gori's chrome (tab bar, panes, overlays) and its views, nothing more: P0
applied to widgets, "minimal, grow-as-needed widgets" rather than a general toolkit. `Screen`
is an immediate-mode drawing surface with bounds-checked writes; the backend keeps its own
front/back cell grid and, on flush, forwards only the cells that changed since the previous
frame. Measured cost lives in `set_cell`, not in highlighting, which is why `Screen` interns
single-cell strings.

Rendering is a pure function of state. Views hold ephemeral display and edit state and expose
`render(screen, rect, focused)`; controllers interpret input and own persistence through
`Host` (P5). Overlays are modal cards centred over the body. Theming is a `Palette` record,
with built-in and user themes switched at runtime.

History searches and host completions run in controller-owned cooperative fibers. Each
controlled Store read holds its own pooled connection and yields through SQLite's progress
handler; putting a synchronous SQLite call in a fiber alone does not release the scheduler.
The controller publishes only the current query generation, retaining the previous rows
with a searching indicator until then. Capture updates queue one subsequent refresh, while
query, scope and view changes cancel obsolete work. Store close cancels and drains controlled
reads before closing the pool; no progress handler is installed on the writer connection.

Width is measured, never assumed: `Screen.draw_width` reports the cells a string will
occupy, and views that draw per grapheme cluster sum the width per cluster so a wide
character is never half-drawn.

The tab bar is **nine numbered slots** (`Chrome::MAX_SLOTS`), and the digits are the primary
way to move between them: `1`-`9` for a slot, `0` for everything else, `⇧1`-`⇧9` and `⇧0` for
the same two gestures one level down on the sub-tab strip. Four consequences are load-bearing.

`0` opens a **filtered picker**, not a dropdown. Nine slots against a twenty-one tab catalog
leaves twelve tabs off the bar, and twelve is a list you type at rather than one you walk;
the ⋯ dropdown it replaced had no filter, could not reach a tab that WAS on the bar, and
carried a key table of its own. It is `FilterPickerOverlay`, the same card the sub-tab picker
is, so "find me a tab" answers to one set of keys at both levels.

The **temporary tenth tab is unnumbered**. Jumping to a hidden tab force-shows it at the far
right of the bar; it is where the operator is standing rather than a slot they arranged, so it
wears no `N:` and `nav.posN` never resolves to it. A digit painted on the bar and a digit in
the keymap have to agree, or the bar lies about itself — hence `visible_slots` returns the
strip AND the slot count rather than letting a caller infer one from the other.

**Shifted digits are normalised in `Keybind`, not bound as punctuation.** A kitty-protocol
terminal reports `⇧3` as `3` plus a shift flag; every other terminal sends `#`. Folding the
punctuation onto `Chord.new("3", shift: true)` — exactly as a typed capital is folded onto
shift+lowercase — keeps ONE chord in the keymap, one label in Help, and one rebind target.
Binding the punctuation instead would have meant two bindings per key and a Help sheet that
was right on half the terminals.

**The default nine are chosen, not truncated to.** `DEFAULT_HIDDEN` names twelve tabs so the
factory bar is Project · Target · History · Intercept · Repeater · Fuzzer · Probe · Issues ·
Notes — capture, triage, record — and the cap never fires on a fresh install. `TABS` keeps its
own order regardless: reconcile uses it to slot a newly-added tab beside its catalog
neighbours in an existing config, so it must keep meaning "where this tab lives relative to
the others", not "the default bar".

An operator who saved their own layout keeps it, truncated by **position**: their first nine
survive in their order, because that order is what their fingers learned, and re-deriving a
"better" nine from a bar someone arranged is the shell overruling them. The fold is announced
**once** (`Runner.settle_tab_slots` persists the truncated layout, so the notice cannot
repeat) and NAMES the tabs that moved — a tab vanishing off the bar with no explanation is the
one outcome this migration exists to prevent. A saved layout that is byte-identical to the
pre-slots default is the exception: its owner never chose those fifteen tabs, so it is dropped
rather than truncated and they simply get the new default. The cap is a setting
(`Settings.tab_slots?`, default on); off, the bar is unbounded and scrolls as it used to,
`1`-`9` still reach its first nine and `0` still reaches everything.

<a id="s6"></a>

## §6 Data model

The Store's domain types live in `src/gori/store/models.cr`; the schema and its ordered
migrations in `src/gori/store/schema.cr`.

- **Flow**: one captured request/response exchange, plus WS messages, h2 frames, and SSE
  events for streaming protocols. Raw request and response bytes are stored verbatim (P7);
  the FTS text is derived for search. Targets are stored ABSOLUTE-form, which is the wire
  truth.
- **Sitemap node**: one node per distinct URL segment (P3), with operator path tags.
- **Issue**: the final output, a human-confirmed finding, triaged, optionally linked to the
  flow, note, or session that evidences it. `flow_id` is the flow it was FILED from — the seed
  `insert_issue` links in the same transaction, and the first row of everything that answers
  "what backs this issue" (the RELATED card, the report's Related list, the JSON/MCP `links`).
  It is not a separate kind of relation; see the 2026-09-12 entry for why it stays a column and
  what a schema fold would have to answer.
- **Frozen evidence**: an immutable copy of ONE exchange — request, response, provenance and
  a SHA-256 of each — taken from a Flow or a Repeater tab at the moment it proved a finding,
  so retention and the next send cannot reach it. Issue membership is mutable and
  many-to-many (`evidence_issue_links`); the bytes and hashes are neither. A snapshot whose
  last Issue link is removed is KEPT as an orphan, findable in the project-wide archive, and
  only its own explicit delete removes it. A Repeater freeze also reports REQUEST DRIFT: the
  row's request is mutable and its response is not rewritten with it, so `repeaters` keeps a
  SHA-256 of the request each send went out with and `Evidence.from_repeater` compares it
  against the request the row holds at freeze time. Decided THEN, from two digests, rather
  than stored on the snapshot — a frozen copy is a statement about its own bytes, and a
  `drifted` column on it would be a statement about a live row that can change afterwards
  (and could not even be recomputed once the tab is closed). Over the SAVED request bytes,
  not the wire: the send seam expands `$NAME` and overlays the active slot, so a wire digest
  would call every tab using either one drifted. A NULL digest is NOT RECORDED, never a
  verdict, so a response persisted before the column existed keeps freezing as it did.
  ONE verb files it. "Link…" and "Link & freeze…" used to sit side by side, which made the
  operator answer "pointer or bytes?" at the moment of FILING — a question about the storage
  model, asked when their attention is on the finding, and whose answer was almost always
  "bytes". So `↵` on an ISSUE row freezes whenever the ref has an exchange, the link is the
  primary act (a refusal, a declined gate or the quota changes what is KEPT, never whether the
  link happened), and the refusal is NAMED in the same toast. The TUI is the surface with an
  operator and a hint line, so it can decide by default; the headless surfaces stay
  MECHANISM-named — `links add` / `add_link` are pointers, `evidence freeze --link` /
  `freeze_evidence` are pointer-plus-copy — because an agent or a script composes verbs and a
  verb that silently did two things would be a worse contract than two that each do one.
  Probe's automatic issue filing does NOT freeze: a snapshot is the operator saying "these
  bytes proved it", and an unconfirmed finding filed by a rule has not said that, nor should
  it spend a bounded budget to guess.
- **Retest**: an Issue's REPRODUCIBLE check — ordered `issue_retest_steps` (each a Repeater
  session, a role, and at most one assertion) plus a bounded `issue_retest_runs` history and
  its per-step rows. Kept OUT of `entity_links`, deliberately: a link answers what material
  is related, a step additionally carries order, role, assertion and execution state, and
  folding the two would make unlinking a piece of evidence delete a test step. Unlike frozen
  evidence it CASCADES with the Issue — a run summary is a statement about one issue's check
  and means nothing detached from it. A step references its Repeater session live (it sends
  what the tab holds at run time); a result row COPIES what it sent, because a run is read
  weeks later and a row that re-resolved would describe a request that never ran.
- **Note**: the running scratchpad and report.
- **Sessions**: persisted Repeater / Fuzzer / Miner / Sequencer / OAST workbench state.
- **Operator message**: a line the operator sends from the TUI to an attached agent session;
  delivered by the first route that answers — inbox socket, `codex queue`, then the
  unconfirmable `claude/channel` push — and, for anything none of them carried, by the next
  tool result or the `operator_messages` poll. Every attempt is recorded as an
  `agent_delivery` event.

Directories are `0700` (`Paths::DIR_MODE`) and the DB, plus its `-wal` and `-shm`
sidecars, are `0600` (`Store.harden_permissions`).

## §7 Decision log

Design decisions that refine a principle, newest last. Append here instead of editing a
principle's wording, so that the label a source comment cites keeps meaning what it meant when
the comment was written.

Format: one `### YYYY-MM-DD: title` block per decision, naming the principle it refines and
the issue or PR that settled it. Adding an entry must not require restructuring anything
above it.

### 2026-08-21: a peer's write must reach the live proxy objects, or fail honestly

Refines: [P1](#p1), [P6](#p6). TUI + MCP coexistence audit.

Three surfaces share one project DB. The gap was not the WAL writer (that queues) but
in-memory objects the capturing process built at open and never re-read: Match&Replace,
extract rules, and probe mode sat on the proxy hot path while MCP `create_rule` /
`set_probe_mode` reported success against the store. The tick (`Runner#apply_external_change`,
headless `App#spawn_reload_loop`) now reloads those objects. Probe mode is adopted from the
persisted row without writing it back, so the tick cannot race a peer's `off` back to
`active`.

Global rewriter/colormarker live in settings.json. The existing 3-way merge is section-granular
and correct for unrelated keys; those two sections hold a list plus its id allocator, so a
wholesale section win minted colliding ids and dropped the peer's rules. They now merge by
rule id, and CRUD re-reads only that section before allocating.

`OpenLock.try_shared` used to give up in ~20 ms and open unannounced. Compact holds the
matching exclusive lock for a second or more, after which a later delete cannot see the
store. `Store.open` now retries on the order of Compact and then fails; unwritable mounts
still proceed. `busy_timeout` still blocks the whole scheduler (SQLite's handler never
returns to Crystal); the comments that said it parked one fiber were wrong, the 5000 ms
value is unchanged.

A `body:` query that cannot drain FTS because a peer holds the writer answers retryable
`FTS_BACKLOG` rather than a short match set. `send_request` classifies a rolled-back
`insert_flow` as `PROJECT_BUSY`, not `INVALID_ARGUMENT`.

A guard against a peer is an INTERRUPTION, not a veto. Every refusal added here is one the
operator can answer: the Issues lost-update guard arms a second `esc` (against the version it
showed, so a further peer write refuses again) and names the conflict in the exit prompts, which
are the last point either version can still be chosen. The refusals that are NOT the operator's
to answer — a `body:` query whose index could not drain — retry the contention first and only
report what survives it, because a guard that reports a collision the process could have waited
out is spending the operator's attention on its own scheduling.

The reload tick is on the render fiber, so its cost is a frame. Both settings folds are gated on
the file's bytes and both reloaded lists re-anchor their selection by id, for the same reason
`IssuesView#apply_filter` gives: a list that moves under a cursor re-aims the next keypress.

The single `ui_state` row goes to the capture holder, which is the tiebreak the intercept
bridge already uses — but the holder is not necessarily a window. A headless `gori run capture`
holds the lock and draws nothing, so a lock-ONLY gate published nothing at all while the
operator's view-only TUI was on screen and told the agent it "may not have run". A view-only
window therefore publishes when no UI-bearing holder is: no row, a row a view-only window
wrote, or a holder's row older than `UI_STATE_TAKEOVER`. Both windows write only when their
own view MOVES, so two idle windows never trade the row, and the holder's write is
unconditional — any activity there reclaims it. The row carries `holds_capture` so the reader
can weigh whose view it is. Since #1091 the row also carries the operator's SELECTION; the
2026-09-18 entry below says why that is relayed as a resolved set rather than as its inputs.

### 2026-07-25: this document restored

Refines: none. Issue #353.

`DESIGN.md` was removed in `ae7674a` and never rewritten, leaving the P0 to P8 labels cited in
47 files with no definition anywhere. Restored from `ae7674a^` and re-verified against the
tree, with the numbering kept as it was ([Numbering](#numbering)) and the layering contract in
[§2.1](#s2-1) written as a runnable check rather than a claim.

### 2026-07-25: one reload semantic for the active-traffic scope gate

Refines: [P5](#p5). Issue #354.

The scope gate on active traffic was enforced at roughly twenty call sites across three
surfaces, and the three disagreed on when a running job re-read the rules. MCP re-read them on
a throttled interval; `gori run` snapshotted at start-up and closed the store, so it could not
re-read at all; the TUI re-read only as a side effect of its own `data_version` poll. The
practical result was that a mid-run EXCLUDE or Sandbox toggle stopped an MCP sweep, was
invisible to a CLI sweep, and stopped a TUI sweep by accident rather than by design.

`Gori::Outbound` now owns the reload: before each Layer-2 check it re-reads the scope from its
store, throttled to `Outbound::RELOAD_INTERVAL` (1s). A per-send DB read is too heavy at high
concurrency, and the clock is advanced *before* the blocking reload so concurrent worker fibers
cannot stampede the store. A failed reload is swallowed and the last-known rules stay in force,
degrading to the old snapshot behaviour rather than to allow-everything.

What that buys is uniform for every LONG-RUNNING job (fuzz, mine, sequence, minimize, active
probe) on all three surfaces, which is where the divergence actually mattered. A one-shot
Repeater send builds a fresh decision per send, so the throttle window never elapses within it
and no reload fires; it reads whatever rules its scope already holds, which for the TUI is the
live session scope the `data_version` poll keeps current.

MCP's semantic won because it is the only one that honours a policy change the operator makes
*while* a sweep is running, which is exactly when they most need it to stop. Adopting it on the
CLI meant the read connection now lives as long as the run (`Outbound#close` releases it)
rather than being closed immediately after the snapshot.

The gate is Store-mediated rather than pushed: nothing notifies a running job of a rule change,
the job pulls the current rules on its own schedule ([P8](#p8)). One consequence is worth
stating, because it is a deliberate tradeoff and not an oversight: a rule written at T is
honoured somewhere in `[T, T + RELOAD_INTERVAL]`, not at T, and sends inside that window use
the previous decision. Making it exact would need a per-send read on the hot path, which
[P6](#p6) rules out.

### 2026-07-25: run assembly belongs to the tool, option parsing to the surface

Refines: [P1](#p1). Issue #356 (fuzz, the reference implementation).

Every multi-surface tool re-implemented its "assemble a run" pipeline once per surface. For the
fuzzer, *template parse → auto-mark → payload sets → matcher → config → generator → sender →
engine* existed three times over (TUI `build_engine`, `gori run fuzz`, MCP `build_fuzz_job`),
and the copies had drifted on things a user can see: the TUI never applied the project's
hostname overrides to a fuzz send, and both `gori run fuzz` and MCP ran `Env.expand` over a
seeding flow's target *twice*, so a var whose value itself contained a `$TOKEN` resolved on
those two surfaces and not in the TUI.

`Fuzz::PlanOptions` (a plain struct) plus `Fuzz::Plan.build(options, outbound)` splits the two
jobs that were tangled: parsing an input format is surface-specific and stays put — an
`OptionParser` on the CLI, the args hash on MCP, view state in the TUI — while everything
downstream of the normalized options has exactly one implementation, and `Fuzz::Engine.new` has
exactly one call site. The same split is intended for `Miner`, `Sequencer`, `Discover` and
`Repeater`.

Three specifics worth recording, because they are choices rather than mechanics:

- **The `Outbound` is an argument, never built by the builder.** Layer-1 strictness differs per
  surface on purpose (`Outbound.agent` / `.cli` / `.interactive`, see the entry above).
  Constructing one inside `Plan.build` would collapse that distinction into whichever policy
  was hard-coded, which is exactly the kind of quiet unification this refactor must not do.
- **`Env.expand` runs once, on the raw template and on the resolved target.** Twice is not a
  no-op: expansion is a single pass, so a second pass resolves tokens that the first pass
  *produced*. Once is the behaviour a user can reason about.
- **The scope gate reads the template's BASELINE rendering, not its raw first line.** The TUI's
  template arrives already marked, so the raw line would have fed `/find?term=§VAL§` into the
  Layer-1 check there while feeding `/find?term=VAL` from the CLI and MCP — and a `§` in a path
  position defeats an anchored include rule. Rendering each position's own default back out is
  marker-free on all three.

A surface still owns its own error wording: `Fuzz::PlanError` carries a machine-readable
`reason`, and each surface renders the sentence naming its own flags (`--auto` / `auto:true` /
`^A params`). Sharing the assembly must not flatten three different vocabularies into one.

### 2026-07-26: the verb registry is a TUI concern, and `ExecContext` is a catalogue

Refines: [P1](#p1). Issue #357.

Two comments described a system that does not exist. `src/gori/verb.cr` promised that one
`Verb::Definition` drives "a keybinding AND a command-palette entry (and later an MCP tool +
CLI subcommand)", and `src/gori/verb/context.cr` called `ExecContext` "thin … deliberately
(P0)". Neither the later nor the thin was true: `grep -rn 'Verb::Registry\|Verb::Definition'
src/gori/cli src/gori/mcp` returns nothing, and the interface declares 266 abstract methods.
Both read as descriptions of the present, which cost reviewers time. The comments are now
corrected; the structure is deliberately unchanged.

Measured on `main` at `57f1812`:

- `ExecContext` requires **266** abstract methods: 42 in `verb/context.cr` and 224 more spread
  across the twenty per-tool files in `verb/context/`, which exist only to hold declarations.
- `Tui::Runner` (with its `runner/*.cr` mixins) defines **534** methods and implements all
  266, none missing. It is the only production implementor; `spec/support/fake_context.cr` is
  a recording double.
- Only the 42 root ones are app chrome and cross-tool actions. The other 224 are tool intents
  grouped by tool (repeater 28, issues 23, probe 22, history 17, fuzzer 17, jwt 13 …) —
  surface-neutral in name.

Collapsing `ExecContext` into direct `Runner` calls was considered and rejected. It would
delete the 266 declarations and the indirection, not the 266 implementations, which the
palette and keymap still have to invoke — a large mechanical edit for no behavioural gain. It
would also destroy the two things the interface does buy: one enumerable catalogue of every
action a verb can trigger, and a one-way dependency, since `verb/` names no `Tui::` in code
([§2.1](#s2-1)). Keeping a 266-method abstraction is not a [P0](#p0) minimalism claim, and it
should stop being written up as one.

Wiring CLI and MCP into the registry was also rejected, for a reason worth recording because
it is not obvious from the method names. Those 224 tool intents are surface-neutral in name
and TUI-coupled in semantics: `repeater_send` means "send the ACTIVE sub-tab",
`probe_rule_toggle` means "toggle the HIGHLIGHTED row". A CLI or MCP caller has no selection,
only an id. Making them callable from another surface therefore requires an argument schema
so an intent can name its target — the field `Verb::Definition` records as absent. That
schema is the prerequisite, not a follow-up to the wiring, and it is a project of its own
across ~224 intents.

So P1's reach stays where [P1](#p1) already describes it: one execution path inside the TUI,
parity elsewhere by calling the same engines. Read P1's closing sentence — "that gap is real,
known, and under decision in issue #357" — as settled by this entry: the gap is deliberate, and
what would close it is the argument schema, not registry wiring. If CLI/MCP parity work resumes
at the rate it ran before, revisit, but open the argument-schema issue first.

### 2026-07-26: Discover's seed waives Layer 1, never Layer 2

Refines: [P4](#p4). Issue #364, surfaced by the review of #354.

`Discover::Engine#seed_frontier` put the seed, `<origin>/robots.txt`, `<origin>/sitemap.xml` and
the origin-root soft-404 calibration straight onto the frontier with no `bounded_url` call.
Every URL the crawl derived afterwards was gated normally, which is why it read as a deliberate
seed exemption rather than a hole, but only the *path-confinement* half had ever been reasoned
about (well-known paths live at the origin, so a run confined to `/app/` has to step outside its
subtree to find them). The scope gate rode along with it by accident.

The exposure was not uniform across the four, and the difference is what settles the decision. A
Layer-1 `in_scope` verdict already implies a clean Layer 2, because `Scope#sandbox_blocks?` and
`Outbound#evaluate` both route through `allowlisted_unlocked?` — so for the **seed** the gap only
ever opened where Layer 1 was waived, which is the TUI and any `--allow-unscoped` run. The three
**derived** requests were exposed on every surface, since they are anchored on `Url.origin` and a
path-scoped include rule never covers them.

The two-layer split in [§3](#s3) already answers this, and the answer is asymmetric on purpose:

- **Layer 1 stays waived for all four.** The seed is what a human typed, which is the same
  argument `Outbound.interactive` makes for the TUI, and every surface has already made that
  decision before the engine runs (`Outbound.agent` refuses an out-of-scope seed, `.cli` refuses
  one on a configured project, `.interactive` waives by name; the CLI and MCP enforce the verdict
  right after `Plan.build`, before a single send). `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` inherit it:
  they are derived from a seed the operator was already authorised to hit and live at that same
  origin by construction. Re-asking the include question here would only re-ask what the surface
  just answered, and on a path-scoped include rule it would break the calibration on every run
  that has one.
- **Layer 2 now applies to all four.** Sandbox's documented promise in [§3](#s3), that a request
  to a host which is not allowlisted is blocked outright, carries no "unless the operator typed
  it" clause, and `Outbound.interactive`'s own contract already says Layer 2 still hard-stops the
  send. "The operator chose this target" was never an argument about Sandbox. Explicit EXCLUDE
  rules come with it (`sweep_block` semantics, not `send_block`): discover is the most automated
  sweep gori has, and its every other URL is judged by the same predicate.

Three specifics worth recording:

- **A blocked seed fails the run, loudly.** The verdict is taken in `Engine#initialize` and
  `Engine#start` emits it as the run's sole terminal `ErrorEvent` (`Engine::SEED_BLOCKED`); it is
  not a skipped enqueue. A blocked seed blocks everything derived from it, so the alternative is
  a run that finishes with zero findings and no reason, which an operator reads as "there is
  nothing there" rather than "gori sent nothing" ([P4](#p4)). A blocked `robots.txt`/`sitemap.xml`
  is skipped silently instead: the crawl is still meaningful without it.
- **A gated calibration still routes its two dependants.** `@seed_calibration_dir` is set whether
  or not the Calibrate task survives the gate. Without it a robots/sitemap outcome falls back to
  `record_page`, whose raw-status trust reports both as findings on a 200-everything server,
  which is the exact false positive the calibration exists to prevent. With it and no baseline
  they go uncounted: no baseline, no claim.
- **The gate is the engine's injected `ScopePolicy`, not an `Outbound`.** `StoreScope#allowed?`
  is already the negation of `sandbox_blocks? || excluded?`, which is `sweep_block`'s predicate,
  and the engine stays Store-free, which is the whole reason that seam exists.

What this does **not** close, deliberately, because each is a separate decision: brute-force and
calibration probes are still authorised by their *directory* rather than per URL, so a `string`
or `regex` EXCLUDE that matches a child but not its parent does not stop them; and
`Plan.resolve_policy` still hands an unconfigured scope an `OpenScope`, so Layer 2 is absent
entirely on a project with Sandbox on and no rules. Both are closed by the two entries below.

### 2026-07-26: a directory verdict does not authorise the URLs under it

Refines: [§3](#s3). Issue #391, the remaining half of the #364 review.

`enqueue_probes` was the only `@frontier <<` site with no gate: it built `Url.parse("#{bl.dir}#{cand}")`
and pushed a Probe straight onto the frontier, and `process_calibrate` sent `"#{dir}#{bogus_name}"`
`calibrate_probes + extensions.size` times the same way. With the defaults that is **~278 real
requests per calibrated directory on one `allowed?` answer about the directory**.

The reason a directory verdict cannot stand in for its children is that only some rule kinds are
monotone under a path append. `host` rules and `string` INCLUDEs are; `string` and `regex`
EXCLUDEs are not, and neither are the `regex` INCLUDEs Sandbox reads as its allowlist — any
`$`-anchored or length-bounded pattern matches a directory and refuses everything beneath it. So
an EXCLUDE on `logout` / `signout` / `shutdown`, the canonical "do not touch destructive
endpoints" rule, was silently ignored by the brute-forcer even though `logout` ships on line 41
of the built-in wordlist, alongside `admin`, `actuator/env`, `.git/config` and `.env`.

The path confine was escapable by the same append: `Url.parse` collapses dot-segments, so a
wordlist entry of `../admin` under an `/app/`-confined run re-parsed to `/admin`, and
`@confine_path` lived only inside `bounded_url`, which probes never reached.

The fix splits by layer rather than by call site, because the two layers have different contracts:

- **Layer 2 moves to `send_with_retries`,** the single funnel all three send sites pass through.
  Calibration probes are built by a *worker* at send time from a random bogus name, so no
  enqueue-time gate can see them at all; this is the only line that can judge them. Brute-force
  candidates are additionally gated in `enqueue_probes`, which keeps a refused one out of the
  frontier and out of `per_dir_cap` instead of spending both on a send that will be refused.
  A refusal returns a benign `Engine::SCOPE_REFUSED` Result in the shape `CappedBackend` already
  uses for the request cap, and is **not** counted as an error: it is a decision the operator
  asked for, not a failure of the run.
- **The path confine moves to `enqueue_probes` only,** via the `confined?` predicate now shared
  with `bounded_url`. It deliberately does *not* go on the send chokepoint: the origin-root
  calibration and the two well-known paths waive the confine on purpose (previous entry), and
  gating there would refuse them on every path-scoped run.
- **Layer 1 (`containment` / `boundary?`) is deliberately NOT re-asked per probe.** It was
  answered for the directory, which is what the crawl actually reached, and [§3](#s3) makes
  Layer 1 the layer whose strictness legitimately varies per surface. Re-asking it would also
  mean a narrow anchored include silently disables brute-force under a directory that include
  itself admitted. Layer 2 is the layer that is identical everywhere, and it is the one that now
  bites every send.

### 2026-07-26: a rule-less scope is not an absent one

Refines: [§3](#s3). Issue #392.

`Plan.resolve_policy` returned `OpenScope` for `scope.nil? || verdict.unscoped?`, and
`unscoped?` is true exactly when `Scope#configured?` is false — that is, whenever the project's
scope has no *rules*. `OpenScope#allowed?` is unconditionally true, so Layer 2 was absent for the
entire run.

Sandbox is enabled independently of rules (`Scope#enable_sandbox` takes none into account), and
with no include rules `sandbox_blocks?` blocks everything, which [§3](#s3) states is deliberate.
So on a project with Sandbox on and no rules the proxy blocked every request and every other
automated sweep refused — `Outbound#sweep_block` skips only on a **nil** scope, never on a
rule-less one — while `gori run discover` and the TUI Discover tab crawled and brute-forced
completely unrestricted. Discover was the sole fail-**open** tool, in the one configuration §3
singles out as fail-closed.

The fix separates the two questions the old condition conflated. `scope.nil?` — genuinely no
project — keeps `OpenScope`, because there is nothing to consult. A rule-less scope now gets
`StoreScope` like any other. This changes containment not at all: `StoreScope#configured?`
delegates to `Scope#configured?`, still false, so scope-aware containment keeps falling back to
same-origin and `boundary?` is never consulted. The only difference is that `allowed?` starts
consulting Sandbox and EXCLUDE, and on an ordinary rule-less project with Sandbox off both are
false — so those runs are byte-for-byte unaffected.

### 2026-07-26: a request line refuses what frames it and encodes what merely breaks it

Refines: [P7](#p7). Issue #394, the remaining half of the #390 review.

`Headers.safe_url?` rejected CR and LF only, but `Sender#build_get` writes
`GET #{target} HTTP/1.1\r\n` and **space is that line's field separator**. `Extract::ATTR`'s
`"([^"]*)"` captures a space, `Url.resolve` strips only the ends, and `URI.parse` keeps it
verbatim in `path` and `query` — so an ordinary `<a href="/my file.pdf">`, which is common in
handwritten HTML, put `GET /my file.pdf HTTP/1.1` on a real socket. No attacker required. A
lenient origin reads target `/my` and version `file.pdf`, so gori requests a resource it did
not record; a strict one 400s, and that 400 diverges from the soft-404 baseline, which
`Calibrate.hit?` scores at +0.50 — a false-POSITIVE source in the brute-forcer, not a cosmetic
defect. The malformed line then persisted into the stored flow head via `Discover::Persist`
(`Import::Builder::CONTROL_CHAR` is `[\x00-\x1f\x7f]`, which does not cover 0x20), so a
byte-exact Repeater re-send reproduced it.

The rule is not restated here. It is `Proxy::Codec::Http1.request_token_safe?` — no octet
`<= 0x20` or `0x7F` reaches a request line raw — which the #397 fix made the one home for
exactly this class, after gori hit it in three subsystems in a week. Discover adds only the
part that is its own: a **repair** for the half of the class that has one.

The remedy splits by what the octet does to the wire, not by which issue found it:

- **CR and LF frame.** They do not corrupt one request line, they end it and begin a second
  message (#390). No author writes one into an href. They are **refused** — dropped at every
  enqueue by `Headers.safe_url?`, refused at the wire by `Sender#fetch` — which keeps #390's
  disposition intact. Encoding them instead would convert a splice attempt into a real request
  for a URL nobody authored, and put `%0D%0A` rows in the operator's Sitemap.
- **SP, TAB, DEL and the remaining C0 separate fields.** They break one line and cannot start a
  second. A space in an href is a real resource a browser fetches, so refusing it would silently
  shrink a crawl's coverage — the failure mode this project treats as worse than an error
  ([P4](#p4)). They are **percent-encoded**, which is lossless and is what every browser does.

This is deliberately the opposite call from #397, which **refuses** an unsafe redirect
`Location` on the same octet class, and the difference is provenance rather than inconsistency.
A page's own `<a href>` is text that page authored and that a browser would encode before
fetching, so encoding reproduces what the link meant. A redirect `Location` is named by whatever
host answered; encoding it would invent a URL the origin never named while gori recorded it as
sent. Same class, same one predicate, different answer because the input is a different kind of
thing.

Encoded at **parse** (`Url.parse`), not in `build_get`, because a URL must have exactly one
spelling: `visit_key`, `template_key`, the Layer-2 gate question, the `Finding`, and the Sitemap
row `Persist` writes all come off the same `Parts`. Encoding only at the wire would leave the
raw octet in all five, so the scope would judge a different URL than the one sent — the exact
two-spellings bug `Url.gate_url` and the seed's `Url.normalize` were introduced to kill. It also
makes discover ask the gate the already-encoded form every other Layer-2 consumer sees, since
those targets arrive off the wire from a real client. The encoding is idempotent (`%` is not in
the class), which `#{bl.dir}#{cand}` and every re-crawled link rely on.

The **host** is refused rather than repaired, by `Url.parse` returning nil: percent-encoding is
defined for a path, not for a reg-name, and `Import::Builder::HOST_INVALID` already records that
a real host never carries one of these octets. That refusal turned out to close the question
#397 left open. #397 could not demonstrate a live path to the unguarded
`CONNECT #{authority} HTTP/1.1` in `proxy/upstream.cr`; there is one, and it runs through here.
A crawled `<a href="http://ac me.acme.test/x">` passes `Headers.safe_url?` (a space is not
CR/LF) and `same_or_subdomain?` containment, and with an upstream proxy configured its host
reaches `Upstream.dial_via_proxy` verbatim. Refusing at parse makes it unreachable, and refusing
at parse is the only place that covers BOTH synthesized request lines — the GET and the CONNECT —
since the CONNECT is built far below any Discover gate. `sender_spec` pins it on the socket.

`Sender#fetch` now refuses the whole class rather than CR/LF. That costs no coverage — the
repairable half never reaches it, having been encoded upstream — and it means the wire seam can
state the invariant it is there to state: a Discover run never puts a malformed or doubled
request line on a connection.

One instance of the same root cause is knowingly left open, because it is outside this
subsystem: `Import::Builder::CONTROL_CHAR` (`import/builder.cr`) still stops at `\x1f`, so a
raw space in a request target imported from a HAR or `--urls` file is stored and replayed
byte-exact. `HOST_INVALID` covers space, but only for the host.

### 2026-07-26: a path-confined run brute-forces its own subtree, and a run that sends nothing says so

Refines: [P4](#p4). Issue #395, adjacent to #393.

`seed_frontier` took the brute-force base from `Url.dir_of(seed)` — everything up to the last
`/` — while `@confine_path` was derived from the seed's full path. For a **file-shaped seed**
(a path with no trailing slash) the two disagreed: on `http://t/api`, `dir_of` is the origin
root `http://t/`, whose path is neither `/api` nor under `/api/`, so `enqueue_dir` went through
`bounded_url`, the confine refused it, and the seed's own subtree was never probed. With
`spider: false, bruteforce: true` — `gori run discover --target https://acme.test/api
--no-spider`, an ordinary invocation — that was the entire run: `sent=0 findings=[]`, a clean
`DoneEvent`, no reason given.

The issue offered two fixes, and the answer is a third that the confine's own documented meaning
already implies. Widening `@confine_path` from `/api` to `/` would spray the built-in wordlist —
`admin`, `logout`, `.git/config`, `.env` — at the origin root of a run the operator explicitly
scoped to `/api`, which is what the confine exists to prevent. Reporting "brute-force has
nothing to do" answers a question nobody asked: a seed path deeper than `/` means *the subtree
rooted here* (`confined?`), so **the brute-force base is that subtree's root as a directory**,
not the seed's containing directory. `/api` and `/api/` therefore both calibrate `http://t/api/`,
`/a/b` calibrates `http://t/a/b/`, and a seed at `/` is unchanged (no confine, so `dir_of`).

Two consequences are worth stating plainly rather than leaving a reader to discover them:

- The base appends a slash the operator did not type. `/api` and `/api/` are distinct resources
  on an origin that cares, and the probes now go under the latter. That is the only reading
  under which a file-shaped seed has a subtree at all, and it is what `build_discover_seed`
  already does when a run is seeded from Sitemap or History.
- A file-shaped seed with the spider on now calibrates **twice**, at `/api/` and at the origin
  root, where it previously calibrated once. The root calibration is the one #393 added to gate
  `robots.txt`/`sitemap.xml`; it used to be reached because `enqueue_dir` had FAILED and left
  `@dirs` empty. Both are needed once the subtree is really probed. The rows of the issue's
  matrix that already brute-forced something — `http://t/` and `http://t/api/` — are unchanged
  in both request count and destination.

`Url.parse` also now collapses a trailing bare `.`, the one dot-segment shape it let through
(`/a/.` trips none of `..`, `./`, `//`). That was harmless while nothing read the seed's path
back, but this entry's derivation does: a seed of `/api/.` produced the confine `/api/.`, which
nothing can satisfy, and the run went straight back to brute-forcing nothing.

Separately, as the general backstop: **a run that puts no request on the wire now ends in a
terminal `ErrorEvent`** (`Engine::NOTHING_TO_SEND`) rather than a `DoneEvent` with zero
findings. The condition is the send counter, deliberately, and not "seeding enqueued nothing" —
an empty frontier is only the shape this issue found. A frontier whose every task is refused
later by the per-URL Layer-2 gate ends in exactly the same silence, and `SCOPE_REFUSED` is a
benign error, so even the error count stays 0. That state became ordinary the moment the gate
started re-reading the scope mid-run (entry below). A run the operator STOPPED is exempt:
stopping before the first send is a decision, not a failure to have anything to do.

### 2026-07-26: Discover's Layer-2 gate reloads on the same schedule as every other sweep

Refines: [P5](#p5). Issue #396, surfaced by the review of #391.

The entry above for #354 records one reload semantic for the active-traffic scope gate: the
scope is re-read from its store before each Layer-2 check, throttled to
`Outbound::RELOAD_INTERVAL`, "uniform for every LONG-RUNNING job … on all three surfaces".
Discover was not honouring it. Its Layer 2 goes through the injected `ScopePolicy`
(`StoreScope#allowed?`) and not through `Outbound#sweep_block`, so `Outbound#refresh` was never
reached: `cli/run/discover.cr` and `mcp/tools/discover.cr` both use the `Outbound` for
`Plan.build` plus the up-front Layer-1 guard and then hand the engine a policy that never calls
back into it. The result was that `gori run project scope add exclude string logout` in a second
terminal stopped an in-flight fuzz, mine or sequence within a second, while an in-flight
discover — potentially thousands of probes — kept going against a start-time snapshot. Only the
TUI was exempt, and by accident: it shares its live `Scope` object, which its own `data_version`
poll reloads.

`StoreScope#allowed?` now performs the same throttled reload, reusing
`Outbound::RELOAD_INTERVAL` rather than naming a second interval — same clock-before-reload
ordering so concurrent worker fibers cannot stampede the store, same swallowed failure so the
last-known rules stay in force rather than the run breaking or failing open. Threading the
`Outbound` into the engine was rejected for the reason the `ScopePolicy` seam exists at all: the
engine is deliberately Store-free ([§2.1](#s2-1)).

**`configured?` is snapshotted at construction, and that is the load-bearing half of this
entry.** It answers "is there a scope to bound the crawl", which is what switches
`Containment::ScopeAware` between the same-origin fallback and `boundary?` — a Layer-1 question.
Delegating it live would let the reload rewrite the containment mode mid-run, and the direction
it rewrites in is catastrophic: on a project with no rules, an operator adding the single
canonical `exclude string logout` flips `configured?` false to true, and `matches_url?` requires
at least one INCLUDE (`Scope#allowlisted_unlocked?` — an excludes-only scope is deliberately not
an allowed range), so `boundary?` becomes false for every URL. The operator asked to skip one
path and the whole crawl would stop, silently, which is the [P4](#p4) failure the entry above
exists to remove. [§3](#s3) and the #354 entry already draw the line this respects: Layer 1's
strictness is settled per surface before the first byte, Layer 2 is the layer that is identical
everywhere and applied continuously. #396 asked for the second, not the first.

`boundary?` itself needs no reload of its own: its only caller (`bounded_url`) asks it
immediately after `allowed?`, so it already reads whatever that call refreshed.

### 2026-07-26: import is deliberately permissive — the host is a URL, the target is a payload

Refines: [P7](#p7). Issue #400.

Import (`src/gori/import/builder.cr`) feeds the replay path, so it obeys [P7](#p7): it stores and
replays operator-supplied malformed input byte-exact rather than sanitising it. A HAR, OpenAPI
spec or `--urls` file is a file the operator deliberately handed gori, describing traffic they
want to reproduce — a CRLF-bearing request line, a raw space in a target, a duplicate `Host` are
the smuggling *payloads* an operator tests with, not corruption to be repaired. Reproducing a
broken request is the point of the tool. This closes the inverse of how #400 was first filed:
the defect was never that a byte slipped *through* the denylist and replayed; it was that a
denylist rejected the operator's payload at all.

The split that makes this safe to state is **host versus target**:

- A control byte or space in the **path or query** is a URL describing a malformed request →
  store it, replay it byte-exact. `URI.parse` copies a literal control byte verbatim into
  `path`/`query`, and `request_head` writes the target onto the request line as-is, so the
  operator's forged message reaches the wire unchanged.
- A control byte or space in the **host** is not a URL at all — a parse failure, not a payload.
  `URI.parse` copies a reg-name authority verbatim, so `not a url at all` becomes a stored
  "host" of literal spaces. `Builder::HOST_INVALID` (`/[\x00-\x20\x7f]/`) rejects it in
  `endpoint`, and the parser's per-entry rescue skips just that entry. This is the ONE reject
  import keeps, and it is a shape check on a URL, not a judgement on a request.

One `CONTROL_CHAR` regex used to match anywhere in the URL and so did both jobs, rejecting the
payload case along with the parse-failure case; removing it and leaning on the pre-existing
`HOST_INVALID` restores the distinction. The send layer already encodes the same principle:
`Codec::Http1.request_token_safe?` (#399) documents itself as applying only where gori
*synthesizes* a request line from bytes a remote chose, never to operator-replay bytes.
`spec/repeater/import_replay_wire_spec.cr` pins that on the socket — an imported CRLF target
replays byte-exact through `Repeater::Plan`, and the guard's own verdict on those same bytes is
`false`, proving it does not gate the replay path.

Two adjacent guards are NOT relaxed by this decision and stay as they were: `HEADER_INJECT`
(CR/LF/NUL in a header name/value) and `reject_inject!` (the same in method / HTTP version /
reason phrase). Those forge a message boundary the same way a CRLF target does, and whether
import should also carry an operator's header-boundary payload is a separate question #400 did
not settle — left rejected pending its own call rather than widened by implication.

### 2026-07-30: an imported request's Host header is the operator's, and carries its port

Refines: [P7](#p7). PR #488 (the port) and its follow-up (the passthrough).

The entry above names "a duplicate `Host`" as one of the payloads import must preserve, but
`Builder.request_head` was doing the opposite: it skipped every incoming `Host` line and
synthesized one from `uri.host`. Two defects fell out of that, found by replaying imported
flows at a raw-echo origin and reading the bytes it received.

- `uri.host` never carries a port, so the synthesized line dropped it. RFC 7230 §5.4 requires
  the port whenever it is not the scheme default, so a HAR recording `Host: 127.0.0.1:8099`
  was stored — and replayed — as `Host: 127.0.0.1`. Name/port-based routing at the origin saw
  a different request than the one imported, and two imports differing only in port became
  indistinguishable by Host. Only the stored `host`/`port` columns were right, so the raw bytes
  and the JSON projection disagreed.
- Synthesizing at all discarded the operator's own bytes. A recorded `Host: evil.example`, or
  the duplicate `Host` this log already called a payload, was silently replaced — so the
  Host-header attack the operator imported could not reproduce.

Resolved as two halves of one rule: **a recorded Host goes out verbatim — order kept,
duplicates kept — and a Host is synthesized only when the source described none.** The
synthesized form now carries `host:port` unless the port is the scheme default
(`Builder.host_header`, reusing `Discover::Url.default_port?`). Sources that describe no
headers (`--urls`, OpenAPI) are the synthesize case; HAR/Postman/Insomnia are the passthrough
case. `Import::Raw` (Burp) never enters Builder and is unaffected.

Safe because gori already permits a Host that disagrees with the dialled host, deliberately:
the scope gate judges `Outbound.scope_url` — the host actually dialled — never the request
line or this header, which is what makes Host-header testing possible at all
([§3](#s3)). The two guards the entry above kept are untouched: `HEADER_INJECT` still rejects
CR/LF/NUL in any header, and `request_head` now applies the same check to the `host` it is
handed, since that field reaches the start of the head and could forge a boundary there.

### 2026-08-09: a crawler that will not read JavaScript cannot find a modern app

Refines: [P4](#p4).

Discover's two techniques both derive their targets from links, and both stopped at the same
wall. `Engine#extract_links` chose its parser from the response: robots.txt by role, a
`<loc>`-bearing body as a sitemap, an html-like content type as HTML — and **everything else as
`EMPTY_LINKS`**. The spider follows `<script src>` like any other link, so a run spent a real
request on the bundle, decoded it, fingerprinted it, and then discarded every route in it. On
anything SPA-shaped that is the whole application: an API route reachable only from JS is by
construction unlinked, so it was invisible to the spider *and* absent from any wordlist. The
same silence covered every JSON response.

Three changes, all inside the engine's existing gates:

- **`Extract.from_text`** takes the `else` branch. It looks for two shapes — an absolute
  http(s) URL, and a root-relative path *opening a quoted string* — because those are spelled
  identically in JS, JSON, YAML and plain text. The quote is the whole false-positive filter: a
  regex literal (`/foo/g`), a MIME type (`application/json`) and a date all fail it. It runs
  over inline `<script>` in HTML too, and `Engine#text_like?` keeps it off binary bodies, which
  a crawl following `<img src>` and `<link href>` meets constantly and which would each cost a
  full `String#scrub` to feed a regex no image can match.
- **`Engine::WELL_KNOWN`** replaces the hard-coded robots.txt/sitemap.xml pair with the
  registry: `sitemap_index.xml` (the Yoast spelling, and the majority of what `sitemap.xml`
  misses) and the `.well-known/` set, of which OIDC Discovery / RFC 8414 / RFC 9728 are the
  highest-yield documents gori fetches at all — one 200 names authorize, token, userinfo, jwks,
  revocation, introspection and registration as absolute URLs. `.well-known` and
  `.well-known/security.txt` *were* in the wordlist already, which is not the same thing: that
  probes them once per calibrated **directory**, never at the origin on a path-confined run,
  and reads nothing they say.
- **`Source::WellKnown`** carries them, and `Engine#well_known?` is the one predicate deciding
  both the routing and the confidence anchor. The 2026-07-26 entry above reasoned about
  "the seed and its two derived well-known paths"; nothing in that reasoning was about the
  number two. All of these are origin-anchored guesses at a fixed path, so all of them waive
  Layer 1 and the path confine, none of them waives Layer 2, and all of them are graded against
  the origin's soft-404 baseline rather than `record_page`'s raw-status trust — a wildcard-200
  origin answers 200 to `/.well-known/openid-configuration` exactly as readily as to
  `/robots.txt`.

Widening what one response yields makes the **orchestrator** the thing to watch, since
`consider_link` runs there and so does `enqueue_probes`, and that fiber is also the only one
dispatching jobs. Both were paid for in the same change: `Extract` de-duplicates within a body
and caps it at `MAX_LINKS`, and `Url.probe` derives a brute-force candidate by concatenation —
one string serving as both the frontier entry and the `seen` key, which are the same string for
any query-less URL. It is an optimization and never a second opinion: it declines every
candidate `Url.parse` would have rewritten, split or refused, and the caller falls back.
`bench/discover_extract_bench.cr` measures the directory loop at 546µs/805kB before and
233µs/251kB after, and `url_spec` pins `probe == parse` across the whole built-in list.

### 2026-08-09: a soft-404 baseline is a snapshot, and origins change their mind

Refines: [P4](#p4).

`Calibrate` recognises the four shapes of "not found" it was built for, and measuring it
against an origin serving all four confirms that: a custom-designed error page on a real 404,
a 200-everything soft-404, one that quotes the requested path back, and a 302-everything login
funnel each yielded the planted endpoint and nothing else. Two things it does *not* recognise
turned up in the same measurement, and they pull in opposite directions.

**A stale baseline reports the whole wordlist.** A `DirBaseline` is measured once, before a
directory's ~315 probes, and never revisited. When the origin's rate limiter tripped on the
8th request, every remaining probe diverged from that snapshot in status *and* length *and*
content — 0.50 + 0.25 + 0.35, clamped — so the run ended `320 found`, of which **310 were the
limiter, every one at confidence 1.0**. This is the ordinary case on a real engagement, not an
exotic one, and it is the worst failure the tool has: not a missed endpoint but a confident
lie, repeated 310 times.

A status guard (`429`/`503` are not evidence of existence) was considered and rejected as the
whole answer: the new uniform response is as often a 200 block page or a 403 as it is a 429,
so the shape to detect is *uniformity*, not a status class. `DirState` now carries the run of
consecutive cleared-and-alike outcomes, and `DRIFT_RUN` of them means the baseline no longer
describes the origin — re-measure the directory, and swap the new baseline into the `DirState`
every queued probe already holds a reference to. Three details are load-bearing:

- **The first member of a run is emitted; the rest are held.** At the moment it arrives, one
  diverging response is indistinguishable from a real finding, so it is reported. The second
  and later are held until the run either breaks (released — an ordinary directory pays only
  the latency of one more outcome) or reaches `DRIFT_RUN` (dropped). That bound is why
  `DRIFT_RUN` can be generous: raising it spends a few more requests, it does not leak more
  false positives, so 12 sits far above a real cluster of same-shell routes.
- **`drifted` is not enough; the baseline needs a GENERATION.** The flag covers the window
  between declaring drift and the re-measurement landing — and is cleared by the very swap
  that strands the probes still in flight, which were scored against the discarded snapshot.
  Caught in testing as a second false positive surviving the guard. A probe now reads the
  baseline and the generation together and carries the pair back; a mismatch means the verdict
  is evidence about nothing.
- **Re-calibration is capped** (`MAX_RECALIBRATIONS`). A limiter that relents and trips again
  would otherwise re-measure forever. Past the cap the directory stops producing findings and
  says so in `RunStats#drift_suppressed`, which all three surfaces now render.

**And the same measurement found the opposite error.** `WildcardOk` required
`fp_novel && length_div`, and the length band is proportional — `max(16, max // 20)`, 5% of the
page. A real page sharing the error page's template, which is what a CMS or SPA soft-404 always
is, lands inside that 5%: a 524-byte `/soft/admin` against a 545-byte soft-404 sat inside
`[518, 572]` and was never reported, however different its content.

Relaxing it to `fp_novel` alone produced **15,013 findings in one directory** against the
path-echoing origin — because there, content divergence *is* the echo. So the conjunction is
now conditional on a measured property rather than assumed, and the measurement is a byte
search, not an inference: each calibration probe looks for its OWN name in its OWN body. It
has to be direct, and the reason is the good kind of subtle. `Fingerprint.dynamic?` skips
all-hex runs of 12 or more so that ids and hashes cannot move a hash, and `bogus_name` is
exactly 16 hex characters — the reflected name is invisible to the very hash the reflection
would show up in. Inferring the echo from an out-of-cluster fingerprint fails too, and fails in
the direction that matters: one extra token in an 80-token page moves a simhash by fewer bits
than `simhash_distance`, while `swagger/v1/swagger.json` contributes four and clears it, so the
inferred test is *less* sensitive than the thing it predicts. The byte search costs no extra
request, and `DirBaseline#label` reports `wildcard-200 (echoes path)` so an operator can see
which of the two they got.

Net, on the five-variant origin: 320 findings with 310 false positives became 12 with 1 — the
single unavoidable one — while `/soft/admin`, which no configuration could previously surface,
is now found.

### 2026-08-16: a race is a count on the plan, not a fifth attack Mode

Refines: [P0](#p0). PR #705.

The Fuzzer's Race (last-byte-sync) mode arrived as `Config#race_count : Int32?`
(`src/gori/fuzz/types.cr`) rather than as a member of `Fuzz::Mode`, which still holds exactly
`Sniper`, `BatteringRam`, `Pitchfork`, `ClusterBomb`.

`Mode` answers one question: how do payload lists combine into the sequence of requests a run
sends. All four members are read by `Generator`, and every one of them produces a stream of
*different* requests. A race produces N copies of the *same* request and bypasses
`Mode`/`Generator` entirely (`Fuzz::Engine#run_race`). Modelling it as a fifth member would
have put a value into an enum that the enum's only consumer cannot consume, and forced an
inert arm into the exhaustive `case` in all three surfaces — structure added to describe a
thing that does not have that shape.

The cost of the choice is that "race" is not spelled the way the other attack shapes are, and
a surface must know to read a second field. That is the right trade while `race_count` is the
only such knob; a second orthogonal send-shape would be the concrete second caller P0 asks
for, and the two should then be generalized together rather than one of them retrofitted into
`Mode`.

### 2026-08-16: a refused send is not an enforcement result

Refines: [P4](#p4). Issues #707, #710.

Extends the 2026-07-26 decision that a run which sends nothing says so, to the case where the
answer is not merely empty but *actively misleading*.

The Authorize tool replays one captured request under several identities and reports whether
access control held. Its verdicts therefore carry a claim about the target. When gori's own
Sandbox or an EXCLUDE rule refuses every send, the run has learned nothing about the target
at all — but the shape of the result is indistinguishable from the shape of a run where the
server rejected every non-baseline identity. Reporting that as `enforced` would state the
strongest possible finding on the strength of traffic that never left the process.

So `Authorize` reports `nothing_sent`, never `enforced`, when every send was blocked, and
says in the same breath that this is not evidence access control works
(`src/gori/mcp/tools/authorize.cr`, `src/gori/cli/run/authorize.cr`). The same reasoning
makes an all-skipped selection raise `PlanError::NothingToSend` carrying the per-flow skip
list rather than returning an empty plan: "we declined to test these four requests, here is
why" and "we tested them and found nothing" are opposite findings and must not share a
rendering.

Authorize also shipped in #707 as a TUI-only tool, against the convention in [§2](#s2) that
every tool reaches all three surfaces over a shared `Plan.build` seam. #710 added
`src/gori/authorize/plan.cr`, `gori run authorize` and the MCP `authorize_*` family. Recorded
here because the gap was not noticed until a structure review looked for it: a new tool's
parity is part of shipping it, not a follow-up, and the seam is the thing that makes the two
non-TUI surfaces cheap enough for that to be true.

### 2026-08-17: a WebSocket flow exports as its handshake plus `_webSocketMessages`

Refines: [P7](#p7). PR "HAR export/import WebSocket messages".

`Export::Har` skipped every `101` by status, on the stated grounds that HAR "has no
representation for WebSocket messages". That was true of the 1.2 spec and false of the format
as it is actually used: Chrome DevTools writes the transcript into an `_webSocketMessages`
array on the entry, and every reader that renders a captured socket reads it. The cost of the
skip was that the one artifact an operator hands to a teammate dropped the only evidence a
WebSocket test produces.

The two obvious repairs were both worse than the skip. Folding the messages into a fabricated
request/response writes an exchange that never happened and — as `skip_reason`'s own comment
says about a status-0 entry — imports straight back as a real one. Inventing a gori-native
field nothing else reads keeps the evidence unreadable to the reader it was exported for.

So the handshake is written as **itself** — it is a real request and a real response — and the
messages ride beside it in Chrome's field. `Import::Har` reads them back into `ws_messages`,
which makes the transcript part of the export→import→export fixed point rather than a one-way
rendering. P7 governs what survives: a message payload keeps its exact bytes, base64 when they
are not valid UTF-8, because an invalid-UTF-8 TEXT frame is an RFC 6455 §8.1 test case and not
corruption to repair. Control frames and the relay's own `[gori] …` advisory rows travel too,
in position, since where an advisory sits is what names the frames it is about.

Two things do not survive, and are stated where they are made rather than left to be
discovered: the V7 frame **shape** has no field in the format (`Export::Har.ws_messages`), and
a message time keeps millisecond fidelity, the same commitment `startedDateTime` already makes
(`Export::Har.epoch_seconds`). `Skip::WebSocket` still exists and now means exactly one thing:
a socket whose transcript is EMPTY, where the entry would carry the upgrade and stand in for
frames that were never captured.

### 2026-08-17: a length declaration is repaired only when asked, and only when unambiguous

Refines: [P7](#p7). PR 7 (the gRPC reframe opt-in).

A gRPC message carries a 5-byte length prefix, and an operator's edit — a hex edit in the
Repeater's gRPC tab, a fuzz payload spliced into the message — changes the payload without
changing that declaration. A real gRPC server rejects the result, and gori used to report
`3 sent · 0 errors` over it. That was fixed by *saying so*: `Fuzz::Progress#grpc_stale`
counts the requests a payload left mis-framed and every surface names it once.

The obvious next step — resync it, the way `Content-Length` is resynced — is the one P7
forbids by default. A deliberately-wrong length prefix is one of the standard gRPC parser
tests, and the same argument `--verbatim` makes for Content-Length makes it here: the bytes
are the test case. So the repair is **opt-in** (`--reframe-grpc`, MCP `reframe_grpc`,
`Fuzz::Config#reframe_grpc?` / `Repeater::PlanOptions#reframe_grpc?`), default **false**, and
the two length declarations in one request deliberately carry **opposite** defaults:
Content-Length is recomputed unless told not to, the gRPC prefix is left alone unless told to.

Even under the opt-in the repair happens only where it is UNAMBIGUOUS. `Proxy::H2::Grpc.reframe`
answers nil — leave the bytes — for a body that already frames end-to-end, for a
client-streaming body (where every prefix present is honest and collapsing them would send a
different message), for a broken streaming body (where "which message grew?" is no longer
answerable from the bytes), and for `grpc-web-text` (whose frames are base64, so no rewrite
stays size-preserving). What is left is the unary case, which is the same shape the Repeater's
gRPC tab has always called reframable. A request the reframe declines is still counted and
still named, so the opt-in never trades a warning for a corrupt body.

Being size-preserving is what lets it run late: only the four length octets change, so the
Content-Length framed over the body stays correct and `Fuzz::Generator`'s payload spans do not
move. It is applied where each tool's bytes become the message — `Generator#emit`, beside the
Content-Length pass, for fuzz; `H2Engine.parse_request` for the Repeater, so the projection
`encoded_request` reports the wire through (MCP `effective_request`, `run show --format raw`)
shows the bytes the send will actually put on it.

### 2026-08-17: Authorize identities are session slots; Bindings is per-slot

Refines: [P4](#p4), [P5](#p5). Extends the 2026-08-16 Authorize entry.

gori had no multi-session primitive. `Env` is one value per key, and `Bindings` (#501) was a
single process-global name→value table, so a project could carry exactly one `$SESSION` at a
time. Authorize needed several and grew its own private answer: an `Identity`, which was a
static header overlay it applied to a captured request before replaying it. That answer was
right and it was in the wrong place — every *other* send seam needed the same thing, and a
second copy under a second name would have made "the admin session" mean one thing in the
Authorize tab and another at a Repeater send.

So there is one type. A **session slot** (`src/gori/session_slot.cr`) is a name, a header
overlay (`set_headers` upsert / `remove_headers` strip), and the extract rules whose observed
values belong to it. `Authorize::Identity` is an alias of it, and the two persist as one JSON
list in one settings row — still keyed `authorize_identities`, because an existing project's
identities *are* its slots and renaming the row would orphan them on upgrade.

`Bindings` is namespaced by that list (`src/gori/session_slots.cr`). A rule some slot claims
writes that slot's table; a rule no slot claims keeps writing the one global table it always
did, which is what makes every playbook written before slots existed keep working unchanged
(`docs/content/playbooks/carry-a-session.md`). Resolution reads the global table with the
**active** slot's written over it, so a slot *shadows* a name rather than introducing a second
syntax to spell — `$SESSION` stays `$SESSION` and the active slot decides whose it is.

The active slot is the send context, and it is applied at the seams that own a request going
onto the wire — `Repeater::Sender`, `Fuzz::Sender`, the intercept forward, and `--bind-from`
by way of the first. `Env.overlay_slot` runs *after* `Env.expand_bindings`: the message's own
references resolve first, then the identity is written over the result, and a `$NAME` inside a
slot's own header value resolves against that slot's table (so `Authorization: Bearer $SESSION`
means one thing on the "admin" slot and another on "user", off one persisted string each).

Three lines this deliberately does not cross:

* **The overlay is header-only.** Content-Length never moves and the body is byte-exact, which
  is what makes it safe to apply to bytes the operator did not author — a captured replay, a
  fuzz template with its payload already spliced. `as-captured` (and no slot at all, the
  default) is the no-overlay baseline.
* **Values still never reach disk.** A slot changes *where* a value lives, never *whether* it
  persists. The active pointer is memory-only for the same reason: restoring "admin is active"
  into an empty admin table on reopen would hand the next send an overlay whose `$SESSION` is
  literal — a 401 with no visible cause.
* **No cookie jar and no auto-login.** A slot carries headers the operator wrote and bindings
  gori observed. RFC 6265 storage, path/domain matching and expiry are a different feature with
  different failure modes, and a macro that decides for itself when to re-authenticate is gori
  acting behind the operator's back (P4). `--bind-from` already replays one flow the operator
  named, which is the same job done explicitly.

The surfaces for selecting and editing slots (TUI, `gori run`, MCP) landed next — see the
2026-08-17 *session slots reach all three surfaces* entry below.

### 2026-08-17: an h2 intercept may buffer a complete body; Match&Replace body still forces h1

Refines: [P4](#p4), [P6](#p6), [P7](#p7). PR #6.

Every HTTP/2 intercept hold used to cover the HEAD only. The reason was structural rather than
a limit: `H2::StreamGate` defers a stream's opening header block and *parks every frame that
arrives behind it* — nothing may overtake a deferred head (RFC 9113 §5.1.1) — so the body was
already in gori's hands, and the hold showed a human the head anyway. A body typed into the
editor was discarded, and `Interceptor::Item#head_only?` existed to let each surface say so
before it acked an edit it could not apply.

The hold now covers head+body when the message declares a `content-length` at or under
`H2::StreamGate::MAX_HOLD_BODY` (1 MiB), or when its head carries END_STREAM and so *is* the
whole message. The queue row then carries the entity, an edit's body is the operator's, and
`release_locked` re-frames it into DATA — moving END_STREAM onto the last DATA frame when the
head had carried it, and leaving it on the trailers when trailers end the message.

Three exclusions keep the head-only hold, each for its own reason rather than by omission:

* **No declared length** — a streaming upload, SSE, a gRPC stream. Buffering means waiting, and
  a body whose end gori cannot predict is a wait with no end ([P6](#p6)).
* **Over the ceiling.** 1 MiB is deliberately below h1's own hold ceiling
  (`ClientConn::MAX_REWRITE_BODY`, 16 MiB), and the asymmetry is the protocol's: an h1
  connection carries one request, an h2 connection multiplexes ~100 concurrent streams, so the
  same number would be a per-connection budget 100x larger on a single-threaded scheduler.
* **A PADDED DATA frame.** Stripping §6.1 padding is `Assembler#data_block`'s job, and a second
  copy of it on the pump fiber would raise where the assembler projects around the failure.

Two consequences are worth stating because they are behaviour changes, not refinements:

1. **The queue row appears when the message finishes arriving, not when its head does.** That is
   h1's own timing (`ClientConn` reads the whole entity before `hold_request`), but on h2 the
   wait also delays later stream opens behind it, because releases follow `@opens` order. It is
   bounded by the declared-length gate — gori only ever waits for an end it can predict — by
   `check_ceiling`, which fails the whole run of slots open past `MAX_DEFERRED_BYTES` plus the
   body it agreed to buffer, and by toggle-off. That last one needed a new seam: a hold still
   buffering has no queue row, so `Interceptor#toggle`'s release cannot reach it. The gate asks
   `Interceptor#holding?` when a frame arrives instead, which is sufficient rather than merely
   cheap — a waiting slot with nothing behind it blocks nobody, and a stream blocked behind one
   only becomes blocked when its own frames reach the gate.
2. **`restore_content_length` does not run on a buffered hold.** The R3-F2 rule (#513) reverts a
   `content-length` an editor computed *for* the operator, because on a head-only hold it
   described bytes gori was not going to send. When the body is held, the edit's body *is* what
   gori sends, so a synced value is simply true and a mismatched one is the §8.1.1 probe the
   operator opened the editor to run. Both go out verbatim — which is what h1 already does with
   the identical edit ([P7](#p7)).

**Match&Replace over a body still forces the h1 downgrade** (`Tls::Tunnel#h2_candidate?`), along
with a body-scoped extract rule and a short-circuit stub, and this decision does not weaken that.
A hold buffers *one* message a human is already waiting on, under a declared length, with the
operator watching. A body rule rewrites *every* matching message on the connection, unattended,
including the ones with no declared length at all — the shapes the hold explicitly refuses to
buffer. They are different bargains, and the downgrade is the honest answer for the second one
until #492 step 5 makes it unnecessary.

### 2026-08-17: a channel that cannot carry the bytes is not a reason to refuse the edit

Refines: [P7](#p7). The WebSocket half of Intercept and of Repeater.

Two surfaces had, for the same reason, stopped short of what the operator was holding the
message to do.

The intercept editor refused to open on a WebSocket BINARY message (opcode 2). The refusal
was correct about its premise — the TextArea round trip is `String.new(raw)` → char ops →
`.to_slice`, which is lossy on non-UTF-8, and on WebSocket that is the common case rather
than the exception — but it answered a *channel* problem by removing the *capability*. You
could hold a protobuf frame, read it, forward it and drop it, and not flip the byte you were
holding it to flip. The answer is the byte channel gori already had: `Tui::HexEdit`, the
Repeater's `^X` buffer, an `Array(UInt8)` that never becomes a String
(`src/gori/tui/intercept_view.cr`, `hex_editing?`). The lossy path is still never taken; it
is simply no longer the only path offered. Where a surface genuinely has no byte channel the
refusal stands and is named — MCP `raw` and CLI `--raw` are text, and both point at
`raw_base64` / `--raw-file` instead.

The WebSocket repeater wrote every recorded client→server message and only then read
(`src/gori/repeater/ws_engine.cr`). A socket carries a conversation, so a script whose Nth
message depends on the answer to the (N-1)th replayed as a burst the server was answering out
of step, and the transcript listed every "out" row ahead of every "in" row whatever the wire
order had been — a derived view contradicting the bytes, which is what P7 exists to forbid.
It now sends one message, drains the answer, and sends the next; the caps and the reassembly
buffer became session state (`DrainState`) so they still bound the whole run and a message
fragmented across an idle gap is still one message. Draining between messages is also what
lets the engine learn mid-script that the peer closed or went away, so it stops and reports
how far it got rather than appending "out" rows for bytes it never wrote. A CLOSE the
*operator* wrote is not a stop condition: "data frames after a CLOSE" is a §5.5.1 test, and
this engine deliberately lets them run it, as it already lets them send a lone CONT or an
unmasked frame.

Not changed, and not by omission: `permessage-deflate` stays unnegotiated and
`Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` stays stripped, and a WebSocket message is still held only when the
catch condition names `proto:ws`.

### 2026-08-17: a declared length is not a deadline

Refines: [P6](#p6). Extends the h2-intercept-buffers-a-body entry above. PR #11.

That entry called the buffering wait bounded, and named its bounds: the declared-length gate
(`holdable_body`), `check_ceiling`, and toggle-off. Two of those three count **bytes that
arrived**, and the third needs a human. So the shape none of them saw was the peer that sends
*nothing*: `POST` with `content-length: 4096` and then silence. No byte arrives, so the ceiling
has nothing to measure; no queue row exists, so `Interceptor#toggle`'s release has nothing to
hand back; and in the request direction that slot sits at the head of `@opens` with every later
stream on the connection parked behind it. A `content-length` promises how big a body is, not
that it is coming.

The wait now has a clock as well as a ceiling. `Slot#waiting_since` is stamped when the hold
starts buffering, and `check_waiting_locked` — which already ran on every inbound frame, for
toggle-off — gives the wait up past `H2::StreamGate::HOLD_WAIT_DEADLINE` (5 seconds) **with
intercept still on**. The exit is the one that was already there rather than a new refusal:
`queue_hold_locked(slot, held, nil)`, i.e. the head-only hold every h2 intercept had before
PR #6. The operator gets a row to forward or drop, the streams behind it move as soon as they
do, and the DATA that eventually turns up streams past untouched.

Still frame-driven, still no timer fiber, and that is the same argument the toggle-off check
makes rather than a weaker version of it: a waiting slot with nothing behind it costs nobody
anything, and the frame that makes a second stream *blocked* — its own HEADERS — is itself an
arrival at this gate, which checks before it defers. A fiber per buffering hold would buy only
the case where the wait is free, and would buy it on the pump's own path ([P6](#p6)).

The cost is stated rather than hidden: a genuinely slow upload that takes more than five
seconds between its head and its last DATA frame is shown to the operator head-only, and its
body goes out unedited. That is a real regression against "the row carries the entity" for slow
honest peers, and it is the trade — gori cannot tell a stalled peer from a slow one without
waiting, and the thing on the other side of the wait is every other stream on the connection.
Nothing else moves: `MAX_HOLD_BODY`, `check_ceiling`'s blasting-peer disposition, and the
"the row appears when the message is complete" timing for bodies that arrive in time are all
unchanged.

### 2026-08-17: a WebSocket drain deadline bounds work, not waiting

Refines: [P6](#p6). Extends the interleaved-WebSocket-repeater entry above. PR #12.

Interleaving made every recorded message wait out an idle gap before the next one left, and
`DRAIN_DEADLINE` was still charged the whole exchange from one `DrainState#started`. So the
60s deadline had quietly become a cap on SCRIPT LENGTH: at the TUI's 3s idle a healthy
30-message subscribe/ack replay was cut off around message 20 — by an origin that had answered
every single message promptly — and `with_unsent_note` blamed "a capture cap", pointing the
operator at `MAX_RECV_*` knobs that had nothing to do with it.

Idle waiting is not work, so it is not charged. A read that ends in `IO::TimeoutError` produced
no frame, and `DrainState#credit_idle` pushes `started` forward by exactly that gap; what the
deadline measures is time spent READING frames, across the whole exchange. The three capture
caps (`MAX_RECV_MESSAGES`, `MAX_RECV_BYTES`, `MAX_DRAIN_FRAMES`) are unchanged and stay
session-wide — they bound how much was captured, which is a different question from how long
the engine ran.

The deadline still exists and still fires, on exactly the case it was written for: an origin
that never goes idle (a keepalive cadence under the idle timeout) is credited nothing, stays
100k frames clear of `MAX_DRAIN_FRAMES`, and would otherwise pin the tab "inflight" for hours.
That stop is now NAMED as the deadline in the unsent-message note, distinct from a capture cap,
because the two have different fixes.

`WsEngine.send` takes the deadline as a parameter defaulting to `DRAIN_DEADLINE`, for the
reason `idle` is already one: the bug is a RATIO (a script longer than `deadline / idle`
messages), and a spec cannot demonstrate it at 60s-scale in a run anyone will wait for. No
surface passes it.

### 2026-08-17: session slots reach all three surfaces

Refines: [P1](#p1), [P4](#p4). Extends the 2026-08-17 session-slots entry. PR #10.

The engine landed with no way to reach it: a slot could only be edited from the Authorize
tab's identities card, and NOTHING could select the active one, so `Env.overlay_slot` was a
seam every send seam called and no operator could arm. This closes that on all three
surfaces at once, as thin adapters — no engine was re-derived, and the layering check
(`spec/layering_spec.cr`) still finds no surface name in `session_slot.cr` /
`session_slots.cr` / `bindings.cr`.

The split each surface makes is the same, and it is the persistence split: **the list is
configuration, the active pointer is send state.**

* **List editing** is one method set on `SessionSlots` (`add` / `update` / `remove` /
  `set_baseline`), so "exactly one baseline" is decided once rather than three times. The
  TUI's identities card is unchanged as a card — but it now reads and writes through
  `Session#slots` instead of the settings row underneath it. That was a live bug: the card
  wrote `Store::AUTHORIZE_IDENTITIES_KEY` directly, so the registry `Bindings` and
  `Env.overlay_slot` hold kept the pre-edit list, and the Authorize tab and a Repeater send
  disagreed about what "admin" was until the project was reopened.
* **Activation** is a picker (`session.slot`, Global/palette, plus a clickable `session:NAME`
  top-bar chip) in the TUI, `set_active_session_slot` on MCP, and `--slot NAME` on
  `gori run repeater|fuzz|mine|sequence|discover`. There is deliberately no
  `gori run session activate`: a `gori run` process sends and exits, so a pointer has nothing
  to span, and persisting one is the exact failure the engine entry rules out. Typing it
  anyway is answered with the flag rather than "unknown subcommand".

Two consequences worth stating because they are UX contracts, not details:

1. **The active slot is READ OUT wherever a send is initiated.** An overlay is applied after
   the editor's bytes, so the Repeater pane shows one request and the wire carries another;
   the `session:NAME` chip, the Repeater's `sending as NAME → host` line, `gori run`'s
   `slot: sending as NAME` on stderr, and MCP's `active` field are the four places that
   reconcile them. The chip is ABSENT while nothing is active — as-captured is the default,
   and a chip that only appears while an overlay is in force makes its appearance the signal.
2. **`--slot` is applied before `--bind-from`.** The seed replay fills the tables of whichever
   slots claim each matched rule, and the run then resolves `$NAME` out of the active one; the
   other order would seed one identity and send as another.

Header values are `[REDACTED]` by default on both new list surfaces (`gori run session list`,
MCP `list_session_slots`), matching `list_env` and the identities card's names-only rows: a
slot's whole job is carrying a credential, and a list is scrollback. `--set` / `set_headers`
parse through `Discover::Headers.parse_lines` — the same parser the TUI form uses — so a
CR/LF-carrying value is refused by name on every surface rather than dropped on one.

### 2026-08-17: the reframe default splits by surface, and hex-editable is not reframe-on-send

Refines: [P1](#p1), [P4](#p4), [P7](#p7). Extends the 2026-08-17 gRPC-reframe entry. PR 13.

The reframe opt-in landed on two of the three surfaces. `gori run fuzz --reframe-grpc` and MCP
`reframe_grpc:` set `Fuzz::Config#reframe_grpc?`; the TUI's Fuzzer never did, so a knob that
exists in the engine was unreachable from the tab most operators actually fuzz from. That is
now a toggle on the ADVANCED card, sitting directly under `Auto Content-Length` because they
are the same kind of knob pointed at the two length declarations one gRPC request carries —
and carrying the opposite default, exactly as the engine entry says they must. The view
neither reframes nor decides what is reframable: it sets one boolean on the `Fuzz::Config`
that `build_engine` already hands `Plan.build`, and `Generator#emit` is unchanged.

The Repeater's gRPC tab had the inverse problem: it reframed *always*, because
`grpc_reframable?` was one flag meaning both "unary, so the payload is hex-editable" and
"reframe on send". Those are different kinds of fact — the first is a property of the capture,
the second is a decision — and fusing them meant the tab could not send what
`gori run repeater send` sends by default. They are split (`grpc_reframe?`, `␣F:FRAME`,
`repeater.toggle-grpc-reframe`); `^X` still needs the first, and only the second is flippable.

**The two defaults differ on purpose, and that is not a parity gap.** Headless the default is
off (P7): the operator names bytes and gori sends them, and a deliberately-wrong length prefix
is a standard gRPC parser test. In the Repeater's gRPC tab the default is **on**, because the
tab's whole reason to exist is that `^X` produces a well-formed unary message — a stale prefix
after a hex edit is the trap the tab already avoids, not a test anyone typed. Turning it off is
how an operator asks for the headless behaviour, and the badge says which one is armed. The
Fuzzer stays off on every surface: there the payload comes from a wordlist, not from a hand
edit, and `Fuzz::Progress#grpc_stale` already reports what a stale prefix cost the run.

Neither toggle is persisted anywhere new. The Repeater's is view state with the same lifetime
as its sibling send knobs (reset to on by `load_grpc`, carried by a tab duplicate); the
Fuzzer's rides the existing `config_json` blob, read back as `|| false` — the opposite of
`update_cl`'s `!= false` — so a session saved before the key existed starts OFF rather than
silently reframing bytes the operator never asked to repair.

### 2026-08-19: a case fold that costs 10x is bought only where it is needed

Refines: [P6](#p6). PR: source audit.

QL's substring fields (`host:` / `path:` / `url:` and bare free text) folded the NEEDLE with
Crystal's full-Unicode `downcase` and the HAYSTACK with SQLite's built-in `lower()`, which is
ASCII-only. For a needle carrying a non-ASCII letter the two never met: a captured
`/Überweisung` was unreachable by `path:` in EVERY spelling, and `InterceptFilter` — the
in-memory implementation of the same predicate — matched the row while History did not. That is
the SQL-vs-memory divergence the 2026-08-13 scope entry already ruled against.

`gori_ci_contains` (Crystal's `downcase.includes?` as a per-connection UDF, `Store::ScopeMatch`)
answers it exactly, and `scope.cr` already routes a `string` rule through it. Routing EVERY
substring term through it does not: measured over 100k flows, `host:` answers in **7ms** through
`lower(col) LIKE ?` and **71ms** through the UDF. Both forms full-scan, so the 10x is not a lost
index — it is a Crystal callback plus two String allocations per row, and History recompiles this
filter on every keystroke. P6 says never stall the data path, and 71ms per keystroke is a stall.

**So the fold is chosen by what the NEEDLE contains** (`QL.contains_cond`): an ASCII needle keeps
the native LIKE, a non-ASCII needle takes the UDF. Every ASCII character folds identically in the
two implementations, so the fast path is exact for the needles that take it — and the whole
pre-existing `spec/ql_spec.cr` SQL corpus is unchanged, which is the evidence for that claim.

Two things this deliberately accepts, recorded rather than hidden:

1. **A residue on the fast path.** A haystack character that folds INTO ASCII under Unicode but
   not under `lower()` — `İ`→`i`, `K`(U+212A)→`k`, `ſ`→`s` — stays unreachable by an ASCII needle.
   Closing it means paying the 10x on every query to serve a case nobody has reported.
2. **Two spellings of one predicate**, which the scope entry warns about. It is safe here only
   because `host`, `method` and `target` are all `NOT NULL`: a NULL haystack would make the arms
   disagree under `NOT` (`NOT (NULL)` drops the row, `NOT (0)` keeps it). A nullable column added
   to this set must re-derive that, not inherit it.

### 2026-08-20: the received request-line is judged by a different rule than the one gori writes

Refines: [P7](#p7). PR: recent-merge audit.

`Codec::Http1.request_token_safe?` is the one home for "may this text go on a request line as one
token" — CR/LF/NUL/SP/HTAB/DEL all refused — and AGENTS.md lists re-deriving it next to a new
caller as a trap. #729's non-HTTP detector (`looks_like_http_request?`) cited that rule and applied
it to the first received byte. Doing so was the trap in the other direction.

The rule is correct for a line gori **synthesizes** (Discover's crawled `href`, the MCP request
builder, the fuzzer's redirect follower): there, an SP is gori forging a request the operator did
not write. It is wrong for a line gori **receives**, where an SP is the operator's payload.
` GET /admin HTTP/1.1` — whitespace before the request-line — is a standard smuggling / WAF
parser-differential probe, and it was being killed at the connection with the flow blaming
`network.tls_passthrough` for the tester's own request. That is exactly the false-positive class
the predicate's own comment swears off, and it sat one row from the `\r\n`-prefixed case
`spec/proxy/codec/http1_spec.cr` already protected.

**So SP and HTAB are carved out of the detector's reject set** (C0-minus-whitespace, plus DEL). No
binary preface begins with SP or HTAB — MQTT `0x10`, AMQP `0x00`, a TLS ClientHello `0x16` are all
caught unchanged — so the carve-out costs nothing the detector exists to buy.

Two things this accepts, recorded rather than hidden:

1. **A whitespace-prefixed non-HTTP protocol waits out the head deadline** again, exactly like the
   SSH/SMTP text banners #729 already documented as a known gap. Same trade, same reason: on the
   first byte a banner and a payload are indistinguishable, and gori does not guess.
2. **Two rules for one shape**, which is normally the thing to avoid. The split is the point here:
   `request_token_safe?` governs what gori WRITES, `looks_like_http_request?` what it READS, and
   a future reader tempted to unify them should re-read P7 first.

### 2026-08-20: a CONNECT gori cannot decode is refused in the open, not relayed in the dark

Refines: [P4](#p4), [P7](#p7). Extends the entry above and #729. PR: #755.

#729 closed the case with bytes to judge. The two it left are both on the TLS path, and both were
silence rather than misclassification: a client that sends **nothing** (SMTP/IMAP/POP3/MySQL — the
SERVER greets first) timed out into `ClientConn#run`'s blanket rescue, and `handle_connect`'s peek
routed `0x50` to the h2c relay and **everything else to a TLS server handshake**, so SSH-over-
CONNECT died in OpenSSL — after `reflect_origin_h2` had already fired a real ALPN-`h2` ClientHello
at the SSH server's port.

Two decisions worth writing down, because both had a tempting alternative.

**The timeout stays; what is RECORDED gets narrower.** "Not HTTP" cannot be separated from "slow
HTTP" by clock (#729), and shortening the wait weakens the slowloris bound `HEAD_DEADLINE` exists
for. So the fix is a predicate, not a duration: a flow is recorded only for a connection that sent
**zero** bytes (`Http1::HeadTimeout#received`) and had **never carried a request**
(`@saw_request`). Drop either term and the normal end of a healthy keep-alive connection starts
writing flows, which is the noise that makes the signal worthless. One innocent shape survives
both terms — a browser's speculative preconnect — and is named in the message rather than filtered
out, because on the wire it is not distinguishable from the case being reported.

**Both halves of the peek widened, not just the TLS one.** `0x50` is `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH` and
`PROPFIND` as well as `PRI`, so the same one-byte assumption sent a plaintext request tunnelled to
port 80 into the HTTP/2 relay — which dials the origin and then dies at `Frame.read_preface` —
while the identical request spelled `GET` took the refusal arm. Behaviour split on the first letter
of the method. `Server` had already solved this for its listeners with a four-octet floor and a
comment stating that a CONNECT tunnel carries only a ClientHello or a preface; that premise is what
this entry refutes, so the predicate moved to `H2::Frame.preface_prefix?` and the TLS twin to
`Tls::ClientHello.record_start?`. Both callers now share one home, and only the two arms that
COMMIT to a protocol read past the first byte — every refusal still decides on one octet.

**A non-TLS CONNECT is refused, not blind-tunnelled**, though the code to relay it sits in the
next branch and doing so would make `ssh -o ProxyCommand='nc -X connect …'` work with no operator
action. #729 turned that trade down on its own terms and it still holds: a silent uncaptured relay
is the anti-pattern `settings/network.cr` names ("a bypassed host is otherwise INVISIBLE"), and
gori already HAS an explicit per-host spelling of exactly that relay. `Settings.tls_passthrough?`
is consulted one branch ABOVE the peek, so the refusal's advice is a one-step fix rather than a
description of some other mode — and the operator, not the first byte on the wire, decides which
hosts leave the capture path (P4).

**The listener peek needed the record too, not just `ClientConn`.** `Server#serve_reverse` and
`#serve_transparent` route on `client.peek`, which blocks *before* any `ClientConn` exists — and
those listeners are the only ones a plaintext server-speaks-first protocol can reach, since
SMTP/IMAP cannot traverse a forward proxy without a CONNECT. (The `socks5` listener, added later,
is a third: it reuses `peek_first` and records the same way, plus its own record for a client that
never sends the greeting.) Recording only in the request loop
would therefore have put the fix everywhere except where #729 says it matters most. Hence
`ClientConn.record_silent_client` in class form: one sentence, reachable without an instance. Those
two sites re-raise after recording, so the accept path still closes the fd and frees the slot — the
change is the silence, not the teardown.

Four things this accepts:

1. **`handle_connect`'s peek read staying silent when IT times out.** A client that opens a tunnel
   and then holds it without a ClientHello is a speculative preconnect, and it is not the shape
   above either — that one sent zero bytes, this one sent a CONNECT. A client that genuinely must
   let the far side speak first is served by listing the host, which skips the peek entirely.
2. **`Tunnel#intercept`'s handshake failure is a `gori.log` line, not a flow**, unlike the
   refusals beside it. There is no `RawRequest` to project one from — the request is exactly what
   the failed handshake prevented, the same reasoning `serve_h2c_prior_knowledge` already applies
   to its own refusal — and the dominant member of that population is a client that does not trust
   the CA yet, which retries. Threading a reason back out through the `TlsMitm#intercept` seam so
   `handle_connect` could record against the CONNECT it holds is the alternative, declined on
   seam-churn grounds for a diagnostic that says the same sentence every time.
   `intercept_self_page` keeps its bare rescue: a client reaches the CA-download page *because*
   it does not trust the CA, so a failure there is the expected first step, not a fault to report.
3. **One flow per silent connection, uncapped** — and the same for `refuse_non_tls_connect`. The
   bounded form (`notice_downgrade`'s once-per-{host, reason} set) is not reachable from a
   per-connection object, and both new records match the discipline of the sibling they sit
   beside: `record_non_http` (#729) and `refuse_h2c` (#731) each write one flow per occurrence for
   an equally retry-prone population. `Server`'s `MAX_CONNECTIONS` slot cap bounds the rate. If
   this floods, the four should get a shared bound together, not one of them alone.
4. **A text banner that speaks and then waits is still silent** — an SSH client that sends its
   banner and blocks for the server's has `received > 0`, so the zero-byte term excludes it. That
   is the term that keeps a slowloris drip from writing a flow per connection, and the banner is
   indistinguishable from a version-fuzzing payload on the first line anyway (the entry above).
   #729 left three shapes; this closes the two that can be told apart from a payload.

### 2026-08-22: an h3 `Alt-Svc` is removed only because the operator said so, and never in silence

Refines: [P4](#p4), [P7](#p7). No issue — the HTTP/3 half of a protocol-coverage sweep.

gori does not intercept HTTP/3. QUIC is UDP and every listener here is a TCP socket, so an
origin answering `Alt-Svc: h3=":443"` is inviting the client onto a transport nothing in this
process can read. What gori had was detection — `Probe::Passive::Tech`'s `tech_http3` and the
once-per-host `alt_svc_h3` event — and no remedy, which leaves the operator holding the one
failure mode where "I found nothing" and "I could not see it" look identical.

`network.strip_alt_svc` is that remedy, and it is **off by default** because of P4 rather than
caution. gori edits a message the operator did not ask it to edit in exactly one place today,
and that place earns it: leave `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` in the handshake and History presents
a deflate stream as the payload, so not editing would make gori lie about its own capture. An
unstripped `Alt-Svc` costs no capture fidelity. It costs a client, silently — which is a reason
to offer the switch, not to throw it for the operator.

Three decisions inside it:

1. **Per field, and only the fields that advertise h3.** `Alt-Svc: clear` is RFC 7838's "forget
   the alternatives you cached", the one spelling of this header gori most wants delivered; a
   plain `h2=":8443"` alternative is another TCP port, still tunnelled and still captured.
   Neither is removed. A field naming both goes whole rather than being re-spelled: value
   surgery would put gori's own rendering of a remote-chosen field on the wire for a saving
   that buys no visibility.
2. **Before Match&Replace, on both transports** — the opposite of where the 101's
   `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` strip sits, and not in disagreement with it. That one prevents a
   protocol desync and so must have the last word over any rule. This one is a blanket policy,
   so a response rule that puts the header back is the operator saying so about ONE host,
   explicitly, and that outranks a switch they threw for all of them.
3. **The store keeps what gori delivered**, which is the answer a Match&Replace head rewrite
   already gives, and the flow's `advisory` quotes what was removed. The consequence is worth
   stating rather than discovering: the passive rule reads the STORED head, so a CAPTURED
   response stops fingerprinting `tech_http3` once the strip is on. That is the right trade in
   both directions — the advisory carries the same evidence per flow, and the event was a
   warning about a bypass that can no longer happen. It is the proxy path only: a response
   gori itself elicited (Repeater, Fuzz, Discover, MCP `send_request`, import) is built by
   `Outbound`, never reaches the seam, and still carries the origin's `Alt-Svc` — which is the
   right way round, since the strip exists to keep a CLIENT on a readable transport and gori's
   own sender has no client to lose.

On HTTP/2 the strip costs the connection its HPACK passthrough: removing a field means
re-encoding the block, and re-encoding is one-way per direction (see `H2::HeadRewrite`'s class
comment), so every later response head on that connection is re-encoded too and gori's encoder
does not index. That is a bytes-on-the-wire price the operator buys visibility with, paid only
while the switch is on — and it is why the h2 half filters the decoded fields directly instead
of going through the h1-text rewrite seam, which refuses any head it cannot round-trip and
would therefore skip exactly the heads most worth stripping.

The parse has one home (`Gori::AltSvc`) and the probe rule delegates to it. Two spellings of
"advertises h3" would mean a flow flagged for a header gori had already taken off the wire, or
a header removed with nothing saying so.

Not addressed, and not fixable here: a host on `network.tls_passthrough` is never decrypted, so
its `Alt-Svc` cannot be stripped; and an h3 route can reach a client out of band (a DNS HTTPS
RR), which no response-side strip reaches. Nor is a field-name spelled with whitespace before
the colon (`Alt-Svc : h3=…`) — `parse_headers` keeps that name unstripped, so gori's own gate
does not recognise the field either, and a conforming recipient rejects it too (RFC 9112 §5.1).
The scan takes `parse_headers`' CRLF line view precisely so that it can never see a field the
projection did not: an LF-framed scan reached inside a value that smuggled a bare LF, and the
head it left behind cost the client a 200 it had been receiving with the switch off. An
obs-fold continuation is dropped with the field it belongs to, and the block is handed the
JOINED value — more than the projection records, deliberately, because this decides what
leaves the machine rather than what gori filed.

### 2026-08-22: a SOCKS5 listener is the pinned-destination path, with the CONNECT threat model

Refines: [P1](#p1), [P7](#p7). No issue — the inbound half of a protocol-coverage sweep.

gori spoke SOCKS5 in one direction only. `network.upstream_rules` has reached an origin THROUGH
someone else's SOCKS proxy for some time (`ssh -D`, Tor, a jump host), while a client that can be
pointed at a proxy but not at an HTTP one — `ALL_PROXY=socks5://`, a runtime whose only proxy
setting is SOCKS — had no way in short of a kernel redirect rule. The `socks5` listener mode is
that way in.

**It is not a new MITM path.** After the handshake, a SOCKS5 connection is the transparent
listener's situation with a better answer: a `{host, port}` from outside the byte stream, routed
on the first byte into the same three arms. `serve_transparent_tls` became `serve_pinned_tls`
when it acquired its second caller, which is what the body always was — TLS whose destination
was DECLARED rather than requested in-band, by the kernel or by a CONNECT request.

**The cleartext arm takes `fixed_host`, not `origin_dst`.** The reverse listener's shape, not
the transparent one's. `origin_dst` pins the DIAL and nothing else, which is right when the
destination came from the kernel and the `Host` header is the only name anyone has; here the
client DECLARED an authority, so on that arm the authority is what History and the scope gate
are told, and a `Host` the same client also chose does not outrank it. The header still goes to
the origin byte-exact (P7) — it is the client's own bytes, and gori is not being asked to
rewrite them. `CONNECT` is refused outright on any pinned connection, reverse included: it is
the one request shape that never reaches `resolve_forward`, so answering it at all would make
the pinned destination negotiable by the client that was just pinned to it.

**On the TLS arm the SNI still wins the NAME**, and that is not the same claim reversed. A
certificate has to be minted for the name the client is about to verify, so `serve_pinned_tls`
keeps `sni || dst[0]` — the leaf, the passthrough list, the Sandbox and History all follow the
SNI — while the DIAL is pinned to the declared destination. That is the split transparent mode
already had between a name and an address, and it is why `dial_addr` carries the SOCKS
destination rather than replacing the name with it. A ClientHello with no SNI falls back to the
declared destination for both.

**The guards do not come with the path.** `serve_transparent` deliberately carries no self-loop
test: `OrigDst.lookup` already refuses the socket's own address, and on that listener nothing
else chooses a destination. SOCKS5 hands the choice to the client, which is the forward-proxy
CONNECT threat model, so it gets the CONNECT answer — the loop test and the Sandbox gate both
run BEFORE `succeeded` goes back, and each refusal is a reply code (0x02, "not allowed by
ruleset") the client can report rather than a connection that drops for no stated reason. Two
tests and not one: `loops_to_self?` resolves host overrides first, so an override pointing back
at this listener is a loop the raw name does not show, while `Settings.serving_address?` is the
one a SOCKS5 client makes reachable at all — it can name a SIBLING socket, the primary
forward-proxy bind included, which no per-listener test sees. On the CLEARTEXT arm the
per-request `loops_to_self?` inside `ClientConn` stays armed on top of both (that one is per
REQUEST, and a keep-alive connection can carry a request for a host the handshake never named);
the TLS and h2c arms have no per-request leg to arm, which is why the handshake gate is where
this is decided rather than an extra layer of defence.

**Every refusal is a flow**, which is #729 and #755's lesson one protocol over. A SOCKS listener
that closes connections in silence is indistinguishable from a broken one, and the population
that reaches this listener by mistake — an HTTP client pointed at the wrong port, a tool asking
for UDP ASSOCIATE — is exactly the one that needs to be told.

Two deliberate refusals in the protocol itself. **NO-AUTH only**: the forward-proxy listener
beside it has no authentication either, and a SOCKS listener asking for a password would be
claiming an access control the rest of the process does not have. **CONNECT only**: BIND needs
a socket opened on the client's behalf, and UDP ASSOCIATE is a datagram relay — the same reason
HTTP/3 is out of reach, since every listener here is a TCP socket. Both are answered with the
code RFC 1928 defines rather than by hanging up.

The wire vocabulary has one home (`Proxy::Socks5`) and both ends use it. gori is now a SOCKS5
client and a SOCKS5 server in the same process; two spellings of what a byte means is how those
two would drift. The first-byte test on this listener is the TWO-byte `ClientHello.record_start?`
(#755) rather than the one-byte test the other listeners use, because a SOCKS listener is where
a non-HTTP protocol is most likely to arrive — `ssh -D` is what most people point at one — and
feeding an SSH banner into an OpenSSL server handshake because its first octet happened to be
0x16 helps nobody.

### 2026-08-23: a service description is a document, not the operator's payload

**Decision.** `Import::XmlMini` — the namespace-aware reader `Import::Wsdl` is built on —
REFUSES a `<!DOCTYPE>` outright, rather than ignoring it and carrying on. That is stricter than
P7, and the strictness is the point: the axis P7 actually names is provenance, and a WSDL is
not the class of bytes P7 protects.

`Import::Raw` is the P7 path. A Burp item's `<request>` holds the wire bytes the operator
captured and will replay; a lying `Content-Length`, a CRLF in the target and a duplicate `Host`
are the payload, and `import/burp.cr` goes out of its way not to scrub them. `Import::Burp`'s
own fixtures carry a benign DOCTYPE, because Burp writes one.

A WSDL holds no such bytes. It is a description gori READS in order to build a request that did
not exist before, and every octet of it reaches the wire only after passing through the XSD
skeleton generator. Nothing in it is evidence. So the two questions a DOCTYPE raises have
different answers than they would on the capture path:

* **Ignoring is not neutral.** An undeclared `&payload;` left in the document decodes to
  nothing, and the `<soap:address location="&payload;/svc">` it sat in becomes a silently WRONG
  endpoint — an import reported as a success that seeds requests at the wrong host. A refusal
  with a message is strictly better than a quietly corrupted seed request.
* **Refusing costs nothing.** Neither WSDL 1.1 nor XML Schema has any use for a DTD, so a
  DOCTYPE in a `.wsdl` is a generator bug or an attack, and no working document is lost.

The security consequence is a side effect of that, not the argument for it, and it is closed at
the root rather than by a counter someone has to remember to check. No external entity can be
declared, and `XmlMini` has no file or network I/O to dereference one with — so there is no XXE.
No internal general entity and no parameter entity can be declared, and `XmlText::NAMED_ENTITIES`
is the fixed five-entry XML predefined table where an unknown `&foo;` stays VERBATIM rather than
expanding — so entity expansion is O(1) in the input by construction, and billion-laughs has
nothing to expand. The same reasoning is why `Import::Wsdl` never follows an `xsd:import`
`schemaLocation`: an importer that fetches one is an importer with the I/O this reader exists
to not have.

Two smaller consequences of the same distinction. `XmlMini` SCRUBS invalid UTF-8 on the way in,
where `Import::Burp` must not — a byte that cannot be text has no meaning in a document whose
only outputs are names, URLs and placeholder values. And an out-of-scope PORT (an
`http:binding`, a JMS transport, a relative address) is reported as a NOTE rather than counted
in `skipped`: `skipped` means a malformed entry, and a .NET WSDL publishing `FooHttpGet` beside
`FooSoap` is not damaged. When nothing at all was generated the first note becomes the error
message, so "every port here is HTTP GET/POST" is a sentence the operator gets to read instead
of the generic "no flows found".

### 2026-08-23: the Fuzzer sweeps a WebSocket, and the handshake is part 0 of its position space

The Repeater could re-establish a WebSocket and replay its frames; the Fuzzer could not touch
one. `gori run fuzz --repeater N` and MCP `fuzz_start{repeater_id}` both refused a WS session in
so many words ("the Fuzzer sweeps HTTP requests, not a framed WebSocket exchange"), which left
the one protocol gori captures, filters (`proto:ws`), intercepts, exports and replays with no
path to the tool an operator reaches for after all of those. gRPC never had this gap and never
needed one: it is a content type over h2, and the Fuzzer has ridden h2 since it existed.

**One variation is one whole session** — dial, handshake, the payload-spliced frame script,
drain, close. The alternative, reusing one socket across payloads, is faster and dishonest: a
WebSocket is not request/response, so nothing attributes an inbound frame to the payload that
provoked it, and the engine's own `WsEngine.exchange` interleaves send-and-drain precisely
because a burst cannot be read back in step. Concurrency therefore means N simultaneous sockets,
which is what it costs to get an answer that means anything.

**A `Fuzz::WsScript` composes one `Template` per part under ONE global position index space**,
rather than a flat delimited pseudo-document. A frame payload is arbitrary bytes — a BIN frame, a
protobuf, a deliberately-invalid-UTF-8 §8.1 test — so no sentinel is safe (P0), and every
buffer-level pass in the pipeline would read a non-request: `urlencoded_positions` would find a
"form body" past the first blank line and `AutoEncode` would percent-encode into a JSON frame.
The composite works because every attack mode, `--mark`, each `¦chain` and the payload-set
contract are defined over the payload-VALUE vector and not over a buffer — so `Mode`,
`Generator`'s four mode methods, `PayloadSet` and `refuse_unusable_chains` are untouched.

**The handshake is part 0 of that space, not an un-fuzzable prefix.** A WS upgrade head IS an
ordinary HTTP request head, so `Template` already fits it; marking `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` or a
cookie in the upgrade is a real test that would otherwise need a refusal. It also keeps the four
passes that read a request as a request — `urlencoded_positions`, `AutoEncode`,
`ContentLength.sync_at`, `Outbound.request_target` — aimed at the one part that is one. The
frames get none of them, and `emit_ws` deliberately does not `shift_spans` a frame across the
handshake's Content-Length rewrite: they are separate buffers, and shifting would move each
frame's payload exclusion off the payload.

**The result is ADAPTED into `Repeater::Result`, not made first-class.** `Fuzz::Sender#send_ws`
synthesizes head = the handshake head (so `status` is the 101 and `--mh` works) and body = the
inbound DATA payloads concatenated, so `Fuzz::Matcher` needs no WebSocket branch and every
surface keeps working. Three exclusions from that body are load-bearing: outbound rows (else a
`--mr` naming the payload self-matches), CONTROL frames (a clean `1000 Normal` close was
appending `\x03\xE8` to every body until a spec caught it), and gori's own `[gori]` advisory
rows. `truncated` maps onto the existing `incomplete?` rather than inventing a second spelling,
and `timed_out` stays false because a WS drain ends on idle by design.

What the row gains is the pair a constant 101 cannot express — `ws_close_code` and
`ws_frames_in` — on the exact precedent of `grpc_status`/`grpc_message`, which exist because a
gRPC `:status` is 200 whether the call was granted or denied. Measured against a local origin
refusing quoted input: three payloads, three `101 · matched` rows, and `close 1000` / `close
1000` / `close 1008` as the only bit separating them.

**Refusals are `Fuzz::WsError < Gori::Error`, not new `PlanError::Reason` members.** That enum is
`case … in`-exhausted by three surfaces, one of which is the TUI Fuzzer tab — out of scope here,
and unable to produce a WebSocket refusal at all. Same argument `ChainError` already makes: a
refusal with no per-surface idiom ("`--race` is HTTP-only" reads identically everywhere) is
written once by the builder and carried by each surface's existing `Gori::Error` path. Only two
things are genuinely refused — `race_count`, and frames handed to a template with no `Upgrade:`
— plus `--http2` and `--record-history` at the surfaces. The merely INERT knobs
(`follow_redirects`, `timeout`, `auto_calibrate`) are reported through `Plan#ws_ignored_knobs`
instead: refusing a run over a flag that changes nothing is hostile, and staying silent is how an
operator comes to believe a sweep followed redirects it never followed.

`--record-history` is refused rather than faked. A recorded WS variation would be a flow whose
head declares `Upgrade: websocket` — so `FlowDetail#websocket?` answers true — carrying a 101
with a synthesized body no 101 has and ZERO `ws_messages` rows: it renders as a WebSocket with an
empty transcript, and re-seeding a repeater from it yields a session with no frames. The honest
version (the handshake as a flow PLUS the transcript through `insert_ws_messages`) needs
`Fuzz::Result` to retain the transcript under `keep_bodies`, which is a retention-budget change
of its own. The TUI Fuzzer tab stays HTTP-only for now, which is the one place this round leaves
the three surfaces short of parity.

### 2026-08-26: the active Scope lens follows flow selection into Comparer

Refines: [P4](#p4). PR #809.

Scope is a display lens rather than a capture boundary: out-of-scope flows remain canonical
project data, but a list used to select a flow should not immediately reveal rows the active lens
just hid in History and Sitemap. The Comparer picker therefore applies `Scope#filter` at its Store
query, before the 2,000-row limit. With the lens off, the filter is `QL::EMPTY` and the picker keeps
showing every captured flow.

The shared `FlowPicker` stays a presentation object over rows supplied by its caller. Applying the
lens at the Comparer open-site changes only that workflow; the entity-link picker keeps its own
unscoped row policy.

P4 is the reason the lens cannot be silent about it. A modal narrowed by a mode the modal never
mentions is a decision applied behind the operator's back, so the picker is TOLD its rows were
lensed and an all-hidden list reads `no flows in scope` (plus `⇧S toggles the lens`) rather than
`no flows captured yet` — the Sitemap's split, on a card that previously had no way to be wrong.
For the same reason the open-site passes `raise_on_error: true`: `Store#search` otherwise degrades
a SQLite failure to an empty result, which on this card is indistinguishable from an empty scope.

### 2026-08-26: upstream proxying is fail-closed for app-owned egress

Refines: [P1](#p1), [P4](#p4), [P5](#p5). #434.

`network.upstream_proxy` used to govern the proxy/send engines but not the updater or OAST's
stdlib HTTP clients. That made the setting read as a catch-all while two owned request paths
could still leave directly. The routing decision now stays in `Settings.upstream_route(host)`
and every app-owned socket, including those service clients, is opened by `Proxy::Upstream`.
An invalid declaration or a failed HTTP CONNECT/SOCKS handshake is a proxy error before any
origin socket; there is no direct retry. The existing blank project pin and ordered `direct`
rules remain explicit operator choices, not accidental fallbacks.

The scalar and ordered rules use the conventional SOCKS distinction uniformly: `socks5`
resolves destination names locally and sends an address literal, while `socks5h` sends RFC 1928
`ATYP DOMAIN` for proxy-side DNS. The local lookup is an intentional operator choice, visible in
both settings editors and the reference documentation rather than an implicit leak. Resolution
failure is a DNS error before the proxy socket is opened; there is still no direct retry. The
proxy endpoint itself is always resolved locally.

Project-scoped proxy authentication is one JSON value in the owner-only project DB, with the
method derived from the pinned route: HTTP Basic for an HTTP CONNECT proxy, RFC 1929 for
SOCKS5. Enabling it turns an inherited catch-all into an explicit project pin; otherwise a
later global edit or first-match rule could send the credential to a different proxy. A
malformed value or credentials without that pin is an invalid route for a matching
destination and fails before an origin socket. The Project editor shows the password only
while its row is focused and masks it again on leave; object inspection and status text remain redacted. Global rules retain
their environment-variable indirection so a shareable `settings.json` still contains no
proxy password.

`net.upstream_destination_host` is a project-only gate in front of the routing precedence.
Missing or `*` preserves the old proxy-all behaviour; a non-match is explicitly direct and
does not fall through to the global rule table or scalar. The same loader installs the gate
for TUI, headless and MCP surfaces, so every gori-owned dial receives the same answer.

### 2026-08-27: agent presence is a flock+sidecar marker, not a DB row

Refines: [P1](#p1), [P6](#p6). #815.

That a `gori mcp` server is attached to a project was recorded nowhere on disk. Three constraints
ruled out a DB heartbeat row: the project picker never opens project databases (it stats files),
a `--read-only` server cannot write one, and a periodic write moves `data_version` and makes every
watching TUI reload rules/scope/bindings on each beat. So presence is a per-process marker under
`<canonical db_path>.agents/`, held for the session with an exclusive flock — the same split as
`CaptureLock` + `CaptureStatus`: the flock is the truth about liveness (the kernel frees it on
SIGKILL, where no `ensure` runs) and the JSON body is decoration. Readers sweep any marker whose
lock they can take. The TUI polls the directory on the DV tick OUTSIDE `apply_external_change`,
because a marker moves no `data_version`. #1091 added a second kind — a gori TUI *window* — and
gave it its own directory rather than a field in the body: `count` must stay parse-free for the
project picker's render path, `parse_entry` has to fall back to a kind when a body will not
parse, and a bound `Tools` always has its own `mcp` marker, so a body-carried kind would have
made "is a window open?" answerable only by a reader that never forgets to filter.

### 2026-08-28: CVSS in issues — optional wire representation with live derivation

Refines: [P4](#p4), [P7](#p7). #575.

An issue finding can record an optional CVSS vector string or numeric score. This is NOT captured
wire, so P7's "keep the bytes as they arrived" does not apply to it: an operator's typing is the
input, and the standard already defines the canonical form of the thing they typed. `Store#insert_issue`
/ `#update_issues` normalise on the way in — the shard's canonical vector (metrics in spec order,
uppercase, every temporal/threat/environmental metric preserved) or a bare score unchanged — so two
operators filing the same finding, one pasting a scanner's lowercase form, leave ONE string in the
column. Every export prints it verbatim and anything downstream keys on it, so two spellings of one
vector is two values. Normalising at the write rather than in each surface that validates one is the
usual chokepoint argument: three validating surfaces are three places to forget.
A value that scores as nothing is kept exactly as given — the surfaces refuse to write new ones, so
anything unscorable reaching the store is legacy or imported, and NULLing it would lose data the write
was never asked to judge.
Verbatim is not the same as unchecked — every write path (TUI, `--cvss`, MCP `cvss`) REFUSES a string
that scores as nothing, because the column is read back through a parser and a value only its own raw
bytes can see is a field written on a command that reported success.
Severity (Info..Critical) is automatically derived from the score band whenever a valid CVSS vector or
score is supplied without an explicit override, across TUI, CLI (`--cvss`), and MCP (`cvss`).
Query filtering (`cvss:>=7.0`, `cvss:3.1`) resolves both numeric comparisons and vector substrings.

SARIF's per-rule `security-severity` folds each result to ONE number — a real CVSS score where the
issue carries one, its severity band's floor where it does not — and takes the maximum. Ranking the
score and the severity as two separate axes lets an unscored Critical be badged as its scored Low
sibling, which inverts the badge's whole promise ("the worst under this rule").

The operator-facing half is one input, not two. The issue form's `cvss` row is a LAUNCHER (`↵` opens
the calculator); the calculator holds the only editable copy of the value, as a `vector:` text field
above the metric rows that build one. Two editable copies of one value on two cards is how they
drift, and a form whose `↵` means "create" cannot also mean "open the builder". The calculator opens
on the LEAST severe vector it can spell, not the worst: a default that files a 9.8 Critical on a bare
`↵` puts a number in someone's report that nobody chose.

The builder writes v3.1 and v4.0, and treats them as SEPARATE ASSESSMENTS rather than two spellings of
one. v4.0 asks questions v3.1 does not (`AT`, and the Vulnerable/Subsequent impact split that replaces
`S`) and FIRST's own guidance is that the two do not convert, so the `version:` row translates nothing:
each version keeps its own selections while the card is open. A translated vector would put a score in
someone's report that nobody assessed. Any version the parser knows is still stored and scored as
typed — the builder is what is limited to two, not the field.

### 2026-08-28: a gRPC field position is a NAME, and a chain over it acts on the value

Refines: [P1](#p1), [P3](#p3), [P7](#p7). Extends the 2026-08-23 WebSocket entry (the composite
position space) and the 2026-08-17 gRPC-reframe entry. PR for #843.

The `.proto` lens landed in three parts and only two shipped: with a descriptor set loaded a
captured message renders as named, typed fields (#823) and the Repeater's `␣E` form edits one and
re-encodes (#837). Fuzzing one was missing, and the reason it could not simply be marked is the
whole design. A `§…§` position is a BYTE RANGE. The value of an `int32` field is the octets of a
varint, so marking one means wrapping markers around a wire encoding — and `-3` is ten
sign-extended octets as `int32`, one zigzagged octet as `sint32`, and something else again as a
`bool` or an enum. There is no payload an operator can write into that range that means anything.

**So the position is the DECLARATION, named rather than marked**: `--field role`, MCP `fields`,
the Fuzzer's **gRPC field(s)** row. The payload is TEXT and `Protobuf::Encoder` — the encoder
#837 specced against a reference-encoded message — decides the bytes. `Fuzz::GrpcFieldTemplate`
is a sibling of `Fuzz::WsScript` and makes the same argument it does: every attack mode, `--mark`,
each position's `¦chain`, `PayloadSet` and `AutoEncode` are defined over the payload-VALUE vector,
so a composite that concatenates its parts' position lists into one index space leaves `Mode`, the
generator's four mode methods and the payload layer untouched. The request's own `§…§` positions
are part 0 and the fields follow, which is what lets a Pitchfork lock a header to a typed field.

**Which fields exist, and which of them can carry a typed value, has ONE author** (P3):
`Protobuf::Lens.read` plus `Protobuf::Encoder.seed`, the same pair the `␣E` form reads its rows
through. #837 renders a field the schema does not declare, and one whose wire type the declaration
contradicts, as READ-ONLY, because re-encoding either would mean picking the schema over the
bytes — the guess the lens exists to avoid. The Fuzzer refuses them as positions for the same
reason and names it, and `^X` / a `§…§` over the octets remains the way to send what the schema
calls impossible. A second notion of "which field is this" is exactly what P3 forbids.

**Everything not fuzzed is COPIED** (P7). A variation is `Protobuf::Encoder.replace`-d out of the
capture's own octets once per field — a splice, not a serializer — so an undeclared field number,
a group, a non-minimal varint some other producer emitted and the unparsed tail of a truncated
capture all survive the whole run. Rendering every position with its own default reproduces the
seed request byte for byte, which is the property the run rests on rather than a nice-to-have.

**The 5-byte prefix follows the message here, and that does not weaken the 2026-08-17 default.**
That entry makes `--reframe-grpc` opt-in because a deliberately-wrong prefix is one of the
standard gRPC parser tests — and it is a statement about a payload spliced into BYTES. A field
position re-encodes the message through the schema at the operator's request, so a prefix
measuring the old length would make every request in the sweep a framing-layer rejection and
nothing else. It is `Proxy::H2::Grpc.frame`, the framer `␣F:FRAME` is built on, not a second one;
a frame whose flag byte carries anything but the compressed and trailer bits is refused rather
than normalized, because gori cannot re-emit it verbatim.

**A `¦chain`, `--encode` and the processor pipeline transform the TEXT, before the declared type
turns it into bytes.** The question is genuinely ambiguous and the other reading is not
defensible: what comes out of `Encoder.encode` is a tag plus a payload the declaration describes,
and base64-ing or hashing THAT yields octets no declaration describes, under a length prefix that
honestly measures garbage. It is also not a test anyone loses — byte-level mutation of a gRPC
body is what a `§…§` position over the same bytes already does. So the chain acts where the value
is still a value: `--field name¦base64-encode` sends the base64 of the payload AS that string, and
the same chain on an `int32` is refused up front, because base64 text is not an integer.

**Refusals arrive before the first dial** (the argument `refuse_unusable_chains` already makes for
a converter). Unlike a chain, "can this declaration hold this text" is answerable with no side
effect and no target, so the payload set is dry-run against the declaration at plan time — bounded,
because a payload set is not, with a render-time backstop that reports the reason on the row and
leaves the capture's octets in place rather than sending something else in silence.

The Miner is deliberately absent: hidden-parameter discovery over a typed schema is a different
question, since the schema already tells you the fields.

### 2026-08-29: the event log gets a human window, and stays one layer below the ring

Refines: [P4](#p4), [P8](#p8). Extends the #124 event-feed entry. Issue #864.

The `events` table records every agent mutation and send, and `log_agent_action`'s own comment
says why: so the AI's activity is *"visible to the human (and tailable via `list_events`)"*. Only
the second half was built. `events_after` served the MCP tool and nothing in `src/gori/tui/` had
ever named the table, so the audit record P4 rests on — the human can see what was decided on
their project — was readable only by the process being audited. The Project tab's ACTIVITY pane
is the missing reader, and the interesting decisions are about what it must NOT become.

**It is a query, not a queue** (P8). A filter bar over a bounded page, the way History is a query
over flows: no inbox, no unread badge, no ranking, and nothing is pushed. Which settles the
question the notification ring raises by existing. `[event log] --(promotion policy)-->
[notification ring]` is a layering, and the two ends differ by orders of magnitude — the ring
holds a hundred notes in memory and dies with the project; the log holds fifty thousand rows on
disk and is the record. Merging them would either drown the interrupt channel or truncate the
record, so this change moves nothing between them: the promotion policy is untouched, no event
becomes a notification, and the pane pushes nothing back.

**A narrowed list narrows in SQL, and then must be bounded — at the retention cap, not below it.**
`list_events` selects `source`/`kind` in Crystal after fetching its page, which is right for a
forward cursor whose `next_cursor` is the max SCANNED id, and wrong for a screenful: a
`source:bindings` chip over a feed of agent rows would hand the operator an empty pane while the
matches sat two pages down. So `events_recent` puts every narrowing in the WHERE — and nothing
indexes `events`, so a predicate matching nothing cannot short-circuit on the LIMIT and scans
until the table runs out, on the fiber that paints the screen.

`recent_agent_actions` met this first and answered with an id floor at `MAX(id) - 5000`. Copying
that constant here was the plan and the measurement refused it: on a full 50k-row feed the
filtered backwards scan answers in **~0.9 ms**, and the windowed form measured *slower* once its
extra `MAX/MIN` lookup was counted. A tighter window buys no time and costs correctness — every
match below it renders as "no events match", a false statement about the operator's own project,
which is the [absence-reads-as-clean](#p4) failure in its purest form. So the window is
`@events_retention` itself: in a store being trimmed the whole feed is inside one window and the
bound can never truncate, while a store that is *not* being trimmed is still bounded.
That store is reachable — `trim_events` runs off FLOW inserts, so an MCP-only process that writes
events and captures nothing grows the table past its cap — and there the pane says
"in the newest N events" rather than claiming nothing matched. The bound and the sentence that
describes it are one decision; a bound whose truncation is invisible is worse than none.
`next_before` carries the same distinction: it names the window edge, not nil, when the window
rather than the feed ran out.

**Absence has two meanings and the pane must not confuse them.** `rows.empty?` means "nothing has
happened" only while nothing is narrowing the list; the moment a chip is on it means "your filter
is hiding it", and the two send the operator in opposite directions. The pane asks the feed
separately, and says the two things in different words — the same discipline History keeps with
`@no_flows`. For the same reason `events_recent` does not rescue to `[]`: `recent_agent_actions`
may, because it garnishes a notification that goes out either way, but here the rows ARE the
answer and a swallowed error rendered as "no activity" is the one reading that tells someone to
stop looking.

**The cursor is an event id.** The list is newest-first and PREPENDS, and an attached agent writes
into it while the operator reads. A row-index cursor slides onto a neighbour the moment that
happens, so `↵` acts on an event nobody selected — the failure `NotificationsOverlay#index_in`
documents. `id` is `AUTOINCREMENT` and never reused, which is what makes it the anchor.

**`↵` honours the producer's declared target rather than guessing.** A row carrying `goto_tab`
chose that tab when it was written — Probe's H3 notice names the Probe tab even though it also
carries a flow — so the declaration wins and `flow_id` is the fallback, which is what makes the
binding failures (the rows that carry only a flow) open the exchange that explains them. The
resolution is a pure function of the row, so an unknown `goto_tab` resolves to nothing rather
than to a Symbol no tab answers to: the feed is written by other processes and outlives any one
build's tab catalog.

**Out of scope, deliberately: any new event producer.** A silent failure that is not in the feed
yet is a one-line `insert_event` in its own change. This one surfaces what was already written —
including the level the feed spells two ways, `"warn"` everywhere and `"warning"` from the
Sequencer, which the filter matches as a set because rows already on disk cannot be respelled.

**The feed had to learn WHO, and the answer already existed.** The first cut recorded what agents
and engines did; a scope rule the operator edited in the TUI and one an agent rewrote through MCP
were indistinguishable, on the one surface whose job is telling them apart. `flows` had answered
the same question since #770 — `source_surface`, spelling it `tui`/`cli`/`mcp` — so `events.actor`
takes those three words rather than minting a second vocabulary for one axis ([P3](#p3)). It is
ambient (`FlowSource.surface`, set once per entry point) and not threaded through, because the
config seam below is shared by all three surfaces and 26 `Scope.load` sites deep: an argument
would have to be carried through five model APIs to arrive somewhere the caller already knew. One
process is one surface, so there is nothing for two callers to disagree about. NULL stays a real
answer — a row from before the column, or an engine acting on nobody's behalf — because a default
would make every un-updated path claim to be a surface it is not.

**Config changes are recorded at the MODEL, not at the surfaces.** `Scope#add`,
`HostOverrides#update`, `Rules#toggle` and `Env.save_project` are what all three surfaces reach,
so one site per change covers TUI, CLI and MCP at once. Recording per surface would be three
copies of each, and the CLI is reliably the copy that gets forgotten — the same argument
`apply_external_change` makes for reloading models rather than views. The gate is the store's own
answer: every one of these returns whether the write COMMITTED (several had to be fixed to, in
earlier entries), and an attempt recorded as a change would put a rule in the audit trail that
never gated a request.

**An audit line must not leak what it exists to protect.** `$KEY` vars are the one config surface
whose content is secret by default, so the line carries NAMES and a count and never a value; an
upstream proxy URL has its userinfo redacted, and the scrubber stays inside the AUTHORITY —
reaching past it turned `http://corp.example/a@b` into `http://••••@b`, erasing the host the line
exists to record. A rewrite rule is named by its match and never by its replacement, which is the
half an operator pastes a token into.

**An MCP-driven change is recorded twice, deliberately.** `log_agent_action` writes the call and
its outcome (including the refusals a config event never sees); the config event writes the value
the tool name cannot carry. Two questions, two rows, one `actor`, separated by the source chip —
a single row would have to drop one of the halves.

### 2026-09-02: a denied baseline anchors nothing, and `Same` must not read as a bypass

Refines: [P4](#p4). Extends the 2026-08-16 Authorize entry.

That entry drew the line at traffic that never left: a run whose sends were all refused reports
`nothing_sent`, never `enforced`, because the shape of "we learned nothing" is indistinguishable
from the shape of "the server held". The same substitution reaches the *other* headline through a
door that entry did not cover.

Authorize's finding is `Same` — a non-baseline identity was served what the baseline was served —
and every surface aggregates a row holding one to BYPASS. The word claims the identity under test
obtained the protected resource. It cannot be true when the BASELINE got a 4xx or a 5xx: the
privileged request this run is anchored on was refused too, so a matching denial is two refusals
and evidence of nothing. In practice that covered the most ordinary inputs the tool has — a
captured flow that 403s, any 404 in a `--query` selection, and the case an operator hits weekly, a
baseline slot whose session cookie has expired, which painted every request in the run red.

So `Judge.verdict` returns `Review` against a denied baseline, in the same position and for the
same stated reason as the `baseline.error` guard immediately above it: a baseline that cannot
anchor a comparison must not have one asserted against it. `Review` is the verdict whose whole
meaning is "the operator judges", the row keeps both statuses on screen, and no finding is lost —
a 4xx/5xx baseline can never have been served the resource, so there was no bypass under it to
miss. The demotion is stated rather than left to be inferred (`Target#baseline_denied?`): a CLI
note per request plus a run tally, MCP's `baseline_denied_count` and a per-result field, and the
TUI's run summary — because a row that quietly stops being red is the same silence this section
keeps refusing.

A 3xx baseline is deliberately NOT included. `302 → /login` is a denial and `302 → /dashboard` is
a grant, and only the `Location` separates them, which is exactly what `redirect_verdict` reads.

### 2026-09-03: `verbatim` is literalness, and it reaches the send seam

Refines: [P4](#p4), [P7](#p7). Issue #910.

`Plan.expand_requests` deliberately leaves a DECLARED session binding for the send seam, so that
a Repeater tab carrying `Authorization: Bearer $SESSION` picks up the live identity on every send
instead of freezing whichever value was held when the tab was built. `verbatim` is the operator
saying, about the same kind of draft, that these bytes ARE the message. The two intentions
genuinely collide, and the collision was being resolved silently in favour of the binding: every
verbatim surface set the BUILDER flag (`expand_request: false`) and nothing else, so a stored
`GET /api?$TOKEN=1` left for the origin as `GET /api?SECRETTOKEN123=1` under a flag whose help
text reads "no `$VAR` expansion". That is a request nobody wrote, and it puts a live credential in
the position the operator chose as a PAYLOAD and into the target's access log.

The operator's word wins, on a field of its own. `PlanOptions#expand_bindings?` (default on) is
carried into `Repeater::Sender`, which ANDs it with `evidence?` once — `resolve_bindings?` — and
every site that reaches the `$NAME` pass asks that one predicate. NOT `evidence: verbatim`, which
reaches the same seam and works: `evidence?` is PROVENANCE, a `--verbatim` send is the operator's
own draft, and spending the provenance word on literalness would make every later reader of it
wrong about who wrote the bytes. (`Fuzz::Sender` does spell this `evidence`, and that is not
drift — there it is *defined* as the maximal verbatim span, so the two words already name one
thing on that side of the tree.)

The flag is set on all three surfaces in one change — `gori run repeater send --verbatim`, MCP
`send_request{raw|repeater_id, verbatim}` — plus the WebSocket handshake head and its frames, and
a spec drives each through its own glue rather than through a hand-built `PlanOptions`. This seam
had already drifted between exactly these surfaces twice, both times because one of them was
edited alone.

The scope gate moves with the pass, and that is the half worth naming: `Sender#refusal` derives
its URL from the bytes AFTER the binding pass, so switching the pass off in `wire` alone would ask
the Sandbox about `/api?SECRETTOKEN123=1` and then put `/api?$TOKEN=1` on the wire — one
path-scoped rule away from a decision taken about a URL that never existed. `send_ws` carried its
own copy of `wire`'s two lines and that copy expanded unconditionally, so the handshake of a
WS tab seeded from a capture was expanding where the HTTP path had stopped; it now goes through
`wire`, and the TUI names the withheld tokens on the WS status line the way the HTTP one already
did — [P4](#p4) is why the suppression is stated rather than merely done.

Making the two agree meant making the gate read `wire`'s OUTPUT rather than deciding a second
time. `send_wire` re-ran the binding pass over bytes already through it, asserting in its own
comment that this was a no-op; it is not, because the pass also CONSUMES the `$$` escape, so the
second run resolved the `$TOKEN` the first run produced from `$$TOKEN`. `refusal_wired` is now the
single implementation of "may these bytes go out" and every send site hands it the final slice —
which also takes a send-group from 2N full-message passes to N. Two consequences are worth
stating rather than leaving to be discovered: under `verbatim` NOTHING interprets the `$` grammar,
so `$$name` is no longer consumed either (write `$name` — it cannot resolve there anyway); and
this is LAYER 2 only. Layer 1 (`request_scope_url`, `repeater_scope_verdict`) still reads the
pre-seam draft, so a send that does expand is asked about two different targets by the two layers.
That is older and wider than this seam — it asks whether an include list should be matched against
a live credential at all — and `verbatim` narrows it, since with the pass off both layers read one
URL.

The SESSION SLOT overlay is deliberately NOT switched off with it, and the answer is stated rather
than inherited. `verbatim` says which BYTES; a slot says WHOSE identity, and an operator asks both
in one command (`--slot admin --verbatim`). Letting the byte answer veto the identity one would
send that command as the stored identity while the operator named another — a silent substitution
in the one direction [P4](#p4) refuses. The no-overlay answer already has a name and it is
`as-captured`. A `$NAME` in a slot's own header value is the one `$NAME` in gori guaranteed to be
a reference and never a payload, so resolving it takes nothing literal away from the operator's
bytes.

### 2026-09-04: TLS to an upstream proxy is a new scheme, and the proxy leg has its own trust

Refines: [P0](#p0), [P4](#p4), [P5](#p5). Issue #3.

An upstream HTTP CONNECT proxy could only be reached in cleartext. `https://` in
`network.upstream_proxy` was already accepted and already meant *the plaintext form* — a
compatibility reading that predates gori speaking TLS to a proxy at all.

**The scheme was not reclaimed.** Redefining `https://` would have moved every existing
operator's egress onto a ClientHello their proxy may not answer, on upgrade, with no edit — the
one shape [P4](#p4) refuses. So `https://` keeps its meaning byte-for-byte and
`Settings::UPSTREAM_TLS_KIND` (`http+tls`) is the new spelling, used as BOTH the rule `kind` and
the URI scheme because those two grammars name one transport and a second word for it is how
they drift. The ambiguity is *reported* rather than enforced: `upstream_proxy_advisory` names
both fixes, `upstream_proxy_warnings` emits it at the two sites `outbound_tls_warnings` already
uses, and editing the split proxy fields in either settings editor normalizes the stored value
to `http://` on save. An untouched value is never rewritten. A portless `http+tls` address
defaults to 443, not 8080: falling back to the plaintext default would dial the cleartext
listener of the same appliance.

**The proxy leg's trust policy is separate from the origin's, and that separation is the
feature.** `network.upstream_proxy_ca` and `network.upstream_proxy_insecure` govern it;
`verify_upstream` / `--insecure-upstream` and the `outbound_tls` table do not, and cannot.
`-k` is a statement about one broken origin, and letting it also stop authenticating the proxy
that carries every session would disarm the one hop the operator did not choose to inspect.
Mechanically the two are separate SSL_CTX caches — the origin's key is
`{verify, alpn, outbound-TLS policy}`, all three of which belong to the destination, so sharing
it would present an origin's client certificate to the proxy and offer `h2` on a leg that only
ever speaks an HTTP/1.1 CONNECT. SNI and the verified name are the PROXY's own hostname, never
the origin's and never a hostname override: an override is a resolver override for the
destination an operator names in a request, and applying it to the proxy would let one table row
redirect the hop carrying the credential. A rejected proxy certificate says so in the proxy's
terms and explicitly declines to offer `--insecure-upstream` as the fix.

**The TLS wrap happens before any request byte.** `CONNECT` names the origin and
`Proxy-Authorization` is a reusable credential; in the plaintext form both are readable by
anything on the path to the proxy. `dial_via_proxy` therefore wraps first and writes second, and
the spec asserts this from the fixture's side — the proxy reports only what it read *after* the
handshake. An `https://` origin through such a proxy is TLS inside TLS, and the origin's
certificate is still verified end to end under its own policy.

**Every dial entry point now returns `IO?`.** `Upstream.dial`/`dial_result` handed back a
`TCPSocket?`, which cannot represent a TLS socket to a proxy. Widening it was mechanical
everywhere except `HttpTransport.wrap_tls`, because the proxy, Repeater, Fuzzer and Miner paths
already read and wrote an `IO` — the h1/h2/WS engines and `ConnPool` were typed that way from
the start. Close ownership stays exact: the TLS wrapper takes `sync_close: true`, so closing the
returned socket closes the descriptor, and `close_proxy_leg` covers the window between the
connect and the wrap where the constructor has raised and nothing else owns the fd
(`Socket::Client.new` frees the SSL object but does not close the io it was handed).

Per-rule TLS fields were deliberately not added ([P0](#p0)): one policy covers every `http+tls`
hop today, and a second TLS proxy with a different trust anchor is what should force the table
column.

### 2026-09-04: RFC 8441 replaces the handshake, so the transport is an `IO` and not a second engine

Refines: [P1](#p1), [P7](#p7). Issue #733.

gori captured a WebSocket opened over HTTP/2 and could not re-open one. The gap was never the
frames — RFC 8441 §5.1 replaces the WebSocket HANDSHAKE and nothing else, so an h2 socket carries
the byte-identical RFC 6455 frames an HTTP/1.1 one carries, and `H2::WsCapture` already read them
with the same codec the h1 relay runs. What was missing was a way to OPEN the socket, and every
surface said so in its own words: three seeds refused, `gori run repeater <flow-id>` sent the
operator to a session route that also refused, and the TUI handed over a plain HTTP tab plus a
status line explaining what it was not carrying.

The seam is an `IO`. `Repeater::H2WsStream` does the extended CONNECT and then presents that
stream's DATA payloads as a byte stream, and `WsEngine`'s scripted exchange — `run_session` →
`exchange` → `drain` → `finish` — runs over it unchanged. A second engine would have meant a
second `DrainState`, a second set of the three §5.4 reassembly moments, a second answer to "did
the peer close", and a second copy of five capture caps, for a protocol whose frames do not differ
at all ([P1](#p1)). The capture side had already drawn this line for the same reason: `WsCapture`
is a reassembler over one codec, not a second parser.

The accounting is borrowed, not re-derived. `H2Engine::SendFlow`, `apply_settings`, `credit`,
`write_header_block`, `window_update`, `ack`, `goaway_reason`, `rst_reason` and the two frame
strippers went public for this, the way `exchange` went public for `H2Pool`. A flow-control window
kept in two places is how the halves of one connection start disagreeing, and `H2Engine`'s own
history has three defects of exactly that shape recorded in its comments.

The BYTES pick the transport, never a flag. An extended CONNECT head and an `Upgrade:` head are
two handshakes for one protocol, and the capture says which it was: `Proxy::WS.extended_connect_request?`
reads the `CONNECT` line plus the `X-Gori-Protocol` marker that `HeadCodec.synth_request` writes
for the `:protocol` pseudo-header, and `WsEngine.send` branches on it. This is the rule
`Repeater::Plan` already followed in picking `WsEngine` over `Engine` — it reads the FINAL wire,
not the stored text — and it is what keeps a surface from being able to disagree with the request
it is about to send. `WsEngine.replayable?` is the one predicate every seed, gate and engine choice
asks; `upgrade_request?` stays the h1 half alone, because it is also what selects the h1 dial.

Nothing is invented ([P7](#p7)). `:protocol` comes from the head's own marker line, which
`H2Engine.parse_request` now folds back into the pseudo-header it was projected from — the exact
inverse of the synthesis, and the fix for a captured extended CONNECT that used to go out as an
ordinary h2 request carrying gori's diagnostic line as a regular field. `:method` and `:path` are
the request line's, and a header the operator kept is a header the origin sees. An h1 handshake is
not fabricated so that the seed can dial, which was the refusal's own argument and remains right.

Every way this fails is REPORTED, because the failure mode a replay path must not have is looking
like a clean run with an empty transcript. An origin that does not advertise
SETTINGS_ENABLE_CONNECT_PROTOCOL is a refusal naming the setting — RFC 8441 §3 forbids sending the
stream without it, so gori does not try and see. A non-2xx is a refusal carrying the origin's own
head, so `answered?` is true exactly as it is for a 403 to an h1 upgrade. A RST_STREAM, a GOAWAY
or a send window that never reopens raises `IO::Error` carrying the peer's stated reason, which
the drain already turns into `DrainState#gone_reason` and from there into the result's note, with
the frames already exchanged kept. And `keep_key` says it has nothing to keep rather than being
ignored: §5.1 carries no `Sec-WebSocket-Key`.

One knob's meaning narrows. `--http2` + a WebSocket script was refused outright; it is now refused
only against an `Upgrade:` handshake, since HTTP/2 has no upgrade mechanism (RFC 9113 §8.1) and an
extended CONNECT IS the h2 form — where `http2` is true by construction from the seed. The
`ws_http_only` / `^V` escape hatch has two stops rather than three on such a tab: WebSocket, or
the CONNECT as a plain h2 request. There is no HTTP/1.1 form of those bytes, and offering one
would have sent `CONNECT /chat` down an h1 socket, where it names a host and not a path.

Out of scope, deliberately: HTTP/3, and Match & Replace or per-message intercept on an h2 socket.
Those two still need a length-CHANGING DATA rewrite, which is what #492 step 5 was closed over,
and the capture advisory keeps saying so.

### 2026-09-05 — History reads yield and cancel without changing QL

Debouncing limits how often a search starts, not how long SQLite owns the single scheduler
thread. A result limit bounds returned rows, not the work needed to find them. History now
uses opt-in Store query controls: an exclusively checked-out read connection installs a
progress handler that yields periodically and interrupts cancelled work. The writer never
gets this handler, and Store close drains controlled reads before finalizing connections.

The controller owns one search worker and one host-completion worker, each with one
replaceable pending request. Query generations prevent obsolete results from being
published; capture updates wait for completion and queue one refresh. Previous rows stay
navigable with an explicit searching indicator. QL predicates, full-project coverage and
the result cap stay unchanged, including short body terms and byte-safe regex matching.

`bench/history_filter_bench.cr` measures query time, scheduler gaps, allocations, cancellation
and capture throughput on 10k/100k/500k fixtures. With 500k 1KB bodies, an absent body regex
held the scheduler for 2.7–3.0 seconds synchronously versus 9–11 ms with query controls;
allocations and total query time were comparable. This is cooperative scheduling, not a
hard deadline: a single regex callback or filesystem operation cannot be preempted.

### 2026-09-11: a named stdin flag reads a pipe, and a terminal is refused

Refines: [P0](#p0), [P4](#p4). Issue #1034.

`--request-stdin` shipped on the rule that a flag the operator NAMED makes blocking until EOF
the answer to what they asked for: a `^D` notice on a tty, then the read. That treated a
terminal as a quiet pipe with a human on the far end. It is not one, and each difference lands
on exactly this door:

- The line discipline **echoes**. The raw request the flag exists to keep out of the process
  listing and the shell history — `Cookie`, `Authorization`, a PII body — goes into the
  scrollback instead, and under a PTY-driven harness into the captured transcript. The flag
  closed one copy of the secret and opened another.
- **`^D` is not EOF.** In canonical mode it flushes the pending line, so a request with no
  trailing newline takes two — one to deliver the last line, one on the now-empty line — and a
  driver that sends one hangs.
- **`MAX_CANON`** truncates a line at 1024/4096 bytes before gori is handed an octet.

Driving termios is not out of reach — `Termisu::Termios` already runs the TUI's pane, and its
`Terminal::Mode.password` clears ECHO — but it answers only the first bullet. Canonical mode
still flushes on `^D` and still truncates at `MAX_CANON`; raw mode removes keyboard EOF
outright. There is no setting under which a terminal delivers a byte-exact multi-line request
and then ends, so the door is refused rather than half-built (P0) and the refusal names the
spellings that work (P4). `Run.stdin_terminal_error` is the one verdict and
`Run.read_stdin_text` the one door.

**What the rule covers:** every stdin road an operator names by FLAG — `--request-stdin`,
`--notes-stdin`, and the four that spell stdin `-` (`sequence --tokens`,
`authorize --identities`, `rewriter --response-file`, and `-` on a `--…-file` flag) — plus a
PATH that resolves to a terminal (`--request-file /dev/stdin` under a tty), which
`read_input_file` checks on the open it was already making.

A WORDLIST path is covered too, through `Gori::TtyPath.terminal?` — one predicate for the
three loaders (`Fuzz::Payload::WordlistFile`, `Miner::Wordlist`, `Discover::Wordlist`), each
raising what its own error funnel already catches. The predicate stats before it opens:
`character_device?` is true for every terminal and false for a FIFO, so the probe never opens
the named pipe whose open would BLOCK until a writer arrives — the one source the lazy
wordlist reader exists to serve. That pre-check is why the predicate has one home rather than
three copies.

**What it does not:** the IMPLICIT stdin roads (`fuzz`/`mine`/`sequence` sources, `decoder`,
`jwt`, `cookie`, `notes`) keep their own `unless STDIN.tty?` fallback — there a terminal means
"no source was given", not "the operator asked for this one". They do share the explicit
doors' `IO::Error` rescue now (`Run.read_stdin_fallback`): fd 0 closed by a cron or systemd
unit used to reach the operator as a Crystal backtrace on all seven.

A pipe and a `< file` redirect are non-tty file descriptors and are unchanged, byte-for-byte,
so no script or CI job moves. A pty-backed but non-interactive fd 0 — `ssh -t`, `docker -t`,
`script -q -c` — IS refused, deliberately: gori cannot tell it from an operator's terminal
without reading termios flags the harness may have set either way, and refusing with a named
alternative beats echoing a secret into a transcript on a guess.

`spec/cli/run/stdin_terminal_spec.cr` drives both arms against real file descriptors (an
`IO.pipe`, a redirect, and a `/dev/ptmx` master) and sweeps `src/gori/cli/` for a direct STDIN
read that carries neither the explicit guard nor an implicit road's own `STDIN.tty?` check.

### 2026-09-12: ↵ shows the exchange in place, and a second key navigates

Refines: [P1](#p1), [P4](#p4). The Issues detail's RELATED card (#1038 follow-up).

RELATED lists two kinds of row and `↵` used to answer them two different ways: a LIVE row
teleported to History/Repeater/Fuzzer/Miner, a FROZEN row opened a read-only card over the
detail. One key, two behaviours, in one list — and which one you got depended on a badge two
columns to the left of the cursor. The project-wide Evidence tab already had the right
grammar, `↵ open · s source`, so RELATED takes it: **↵ SHOWS the row's exchange in place, `s`
GOES to the tab it lives in.** Each key does one thing on every row.

A LIVE row is shown through an `Evidence::Snapshot` of the source as it is now, on the same
card the frozen copy uses — not through the History drill-in, even for a flow that has a live
id to hand it. The argument is the one already written above `EvidenceViewer`: the drill-in's
verbs act on a live id (delete it, link it, probe it, send it to the Repeater), every one of
them would have to be gated behind "you are only reading", and one missed gate is an operator
deleting the flow they thought they were reading. ↵ on a RELATED row is a READ; reading must
not put destructive verbs one keystroke from the reader. The card's one action, `f`, only
ever ADDS — it freezes what is on screen onto the open issue and flips the title to
`FROZEN EVIDENCE #N` without closing.

The snapshot comes from `Evidence.snapshot_for`, the builder the freeze itself uses, so what ↵
shows and what `f` would keep are the same bytes by construction rather than by two code paths
agreeing. Its refusal sentences are written for a freeze ("…then freeze the exchange"); ↵ keeps
the FACT verbatim from that one builder and re-points only the advice at the key this path has
(`s`), and only when the source is still there for `s` to open.

A LIVE view says so everywhere the frozen one says "frozen": the title (`LIVE hist #12`), the
provenance line (`as it is now · not frozen`), the border slot, and the chip strip (`live copy
— retention or the next send can change it`). It also names REQUEST DRIFT, which a frozen card
can never carry because the freeze gate asks about it first — a live card is looking straight
at a Repeater tab whose request was edited after its stored response, and not saying so would
be the card presenting two halves as one exchange.

**Fuzz and miner rows are the honest exception.** A session is a template plus a run and has
no single exchange to put on a card, so ↵ there navigates, and the hint token swaps to
`↵ open session` rather than promising a view that cannot exist. It is read off
`Evidence.freezable?` — the same predicate the freeze gate and the `f` token read — so the
three cannot disagree about which rows have an exchange.
### 2026-09-12: the primary flow is the first related row

Refines: [P1](#p1), [P4](#p4). The Issues detail's RELATED card, continuing the ↵/`s` entry above.

An Issue relates to traffic four ways — `issues.flow_id`, `entity_links`, frozen evidence,
retest steps — and it used to PRESENT the first of them as a different KIND of thing from the
rest. The detail drew `flow  GET /login → 200` as a meta row above the RELATED card; the
Markdown report wrote `- **Flow:** …` above its `### Related` list; and both had to hide the
flow from the list underneath (`Links.dedupe_issue_flow`) so it would not appear twice. Three
places spelling one fact, and the operator arriving at the card with one question — what backs
this issue — got the answer split across a line and a list in two vocabularies.

So the primary flow is simply the FIRST RELATED ROW. `Links.issue_links` is the one ordering:
primary first, exactly once, then the other links in link order, then the frozen copies. The
row is LIVE-badged like any other pointer, which makes every key on the card mean one thing on
every row — `s` opens it in History (the act the removed `o` had its own key for), `↵` shows
its bytes, `f` freezes them, `r` sends it to the Repeater. The meta block drops from four rows
to three and NOTES gains the row, which is the pane an operator reads and types in.

`r` moved with it. It used to read `issues.flow_id` and nothing else — a card verb acting on a
fact the card did not show, while the cursor sat on a row it ignored — and now takes the row
under the cursor: a live flow's capture, or a FROZEN row's frozen request through
`duplicate_evidence_into_repeater`, the builder the Evidence tab's own `r` calls, so the
WebSocket-handshake caveat cannot drift into two wordings. A cursor on a row it cannot send —
a fuzz or miner session, a live Repeater row `s` already opens — FALLS BACK to the first flow
row, because that is what the key meant before it looked at the cursor at all.

A `flow_id` whose `entity_links` row is missing SYNTHESISES the row (`id = 0`, never removable
by id) rather than dropping it. `insert_issue` has written that link since the table existed,
so the shapes that reach it are an issue filed before that migration, an imported project, or
a link deleted by SQL — and in all three the issue's own seed would otherwise vanish from the
card and the report. A pruned flow is NOT one of them: `detach_flow_refs` nulls `issues.flow_id`
along with the link, so an issue whose evidence was pruned has no primary rather than a
dangling one.

**The column stays.** `issues.flow_id` is the seed `insert_issue` links from in one
transaction, the source of the SARIF result's `webRequest`/`webResponse`, and what
`gori run issues create --flow`, MCP `create_issue(flow_id:)`, the Probe analyzer's automatic
filing and the Sequencer's promotion all write. It is also kept as a field in the JSON export
and in MCP `get_issue`/`list_issues`, documented there as "the first linked flow" — the compat
spelling of `links[0]`.

What a later SCHEMA fold would need, in the order it would have to answer them:

- **The five writers.** Every one passes a flow id positionally to `insert_issue`; folding the
  column means each writes a link instead, and `insert_issue` loses a parameter that four
  surfaces' argument validation is currently written against (`--flow`'s range and existence
  refusals, `create_issue`'s two `flow_id` errors).
- **SARIF.** `Export.sarif` reads `f.flow_id` per issue to build `webRequest`/`webResponse` and
  the result's location. Without the column it would have to pick a flow out of the links —
  which means the ORDER in `entity_links` becomes load-bearing for a document format, where
  today it is only a display order.
- **Order itself.** `list_links` orders by `(created_at, id)`, and the primary is first only
  because `insert_issue` writes it in the issue's own transaction. A fold needs an explicit
  rank (a column on `entity_links`, or a `role`), or "the first one" stops being a fact.
- **The JSON/MCP field.** `flow_id` would become derived (`links[0]` where kind is flow) or be
  dropped, which is a breaking change for a reader that has only ever read the field.
- **The dedupe that is left.** The "Manage links" card still takes the primary OUT
  (`Links.dedupe_issue_flow`), because it lists REMOVABLE pointers and the primary is a column
  — removing its row there would delete an `entity_links` row and change nothing on screen. A
  fold is exactly what would make the primary removable, and that card is where it would show.
### 2026-09-12: the editor keys are verbs, and the focus dimension is a scope at the head of the chain

Eleven text-editor panes answered `i`, `↵`, `x`, `y` and `b` with a hand-rolled arm in their
controller's `handle_body_key`, which the Runner dispatches *before* the keymap. So those keys
were not rebindable, did not appear in the hotkey editor as anything that worked, and silently
shadowed whatever the keymap held for the same letter — including chords the verbs beside them
already declared. `repeater.select-line` had carried `x` since it was written and could never
fire; `project.select-line` and `project.copy` had their chords REMOVED to stop advertising a
rebind that moved nothing; the Repeater response carried a bare `b` that aliased the global
`^B` in one pane and nowhere else. KEY_AUDIT §1.4/§2d/§2e is the full list.

The root cause is one sentence: **`Keymap#lookup` is keyed by `Scope` alone, and a `Scope` names
a TAB.** The Repeater binds one scope across a request EDITOR and a read-only RESPONSE, so
"`↵` starts typing here, `↵` re-sends there" was not a thing two chords could say, and the
second meaning had to be hand-rolled. Every arm in the audit is a pane disambiguating itself
because the table could not.

The fix is a **scope CHAIN** rather than a second key in the table. `Verb::Scope::Editor` is
consulted first, then the active tab's scope, then Global, each link gated by `available?`
(`Runner#resolve_verb_id`). Editor joins the chain only while a text-editor pane holds focus —
`TabController#editor_pane?`, which every editing controller answers — and drops out the moment
focus leaves. Two properties follow, and they are the whole argument for the chain over the
alternatives:

- **The tab keeps its vocabulary.** Editor sits AHEAD of the tab scope, not instead of it, so
  `{repeater.copy}`, the Notes sub-tab keys and the Global breath keys all still resolve behind
  it. A per-pane scope that REPLACED the tab's would have cost every editor pane the rest of
  its tab.
- **The read-only pane beside an editor is not an editor pane**, so Editor is absent from the
  chain there. That is what lets `↵` be `editor.insert` in the Repeater request and
  `repeater.send-enter` in the response with two ordinary chords — the exact case the keymap
  could not express — and it keeps `insert_key_refusal` meaningful, since the pane that refuses
  `i` is by definition the pane the Editor scope is not on.

The alternative considered was an `available:` gate reading the focused pane, which is what
`read_edit.cr` already does for `x`/`y`. It works for a verb that exists once per tab and does
not scale to a verb that should exist ONCE: `editor.insert` would have become nine near-identical
registrations, and a keyset respelling the family would have had to name all nine.

**Editor is a KEYMAP scope, not a MENU scope.** The space menu renders exactly one `Scope`, and
an EDITOR bucket merged into the eight tab menus has no collision-free set of mnemonics — the
letters free across all eight are `G I J Q U W X Z b j u z`, and `SpaceMenu#verb_for` is a
first-match find, so a clash makes one entry silently unreachable. The editor family is
discoverable instead through the hint strips (which name it with `{editor.insert}` tokens, so a
rebind reaches them), the Help sheet's verb rows, and `settings:keys`.

What did NOT become a verb, and why: **`esc`** and **`^Z`/`^F`/`^G`** are registered but sit in
`Hotkeys::FIXED_IDS`, because a hardcoded handler answers each before the keymap and always
must — `esc` is how you leave a pane that is swallowing every printable, and the three Ctrl
chords are guard-claimed (`CLAIMED_CTRL_LETTERS`). They are declared so Help can name them and
so a keyset has a row to give a second, bare spelling. **⇧arrow selection** stays structural:
`Keybind.from_event` encodes it, but the extend-selection semantics live inside `TextArea` /
`ReadPane` motion, not in a chord. And **nothing that edits was added** — no delete-line, no
open-line, no join. A READ-mode pane is a caret, a selection and a copy; naming keys for
operations that do not exist would make the keyset a promise the editors cannot keep.

### 2026-09-12: an editor keyset is a mapping, and the order is user > keyset > profile > default

Vim users stumble on exactly one gesture in gori's editors: READ mode is helix-shaped, so `x`
selects the line and `y` then copies the selection, where the same hand wants `V` then `y`.
Everything else in the pane — `i` in, `esc` out, `y` copies, ⇧arrows extend — gori already
spells the way vim does.

So the answer is a **keyset**: a named bundle of key overrides for the small, fixed set of
editor verbs, which is precisely what `OsProfile::OVERRIDES` already is, one layer up. It is
NOT an emulation, and the distinction is load-bearing rather than modest. An emulation implies
an operator-pending grammar (`d` waiting for a motion), registers, counts and text objects,
and gori's READ pane has none of those to drive — a `ReadPane` is a caret, a selection and a
copy. `Verb::Keyset::VIM` therefore contains only rows that RESPELL a verb that already
exists, and the things it cannot offer are named in `docs/content/guide/hotkeys.md` rather
than approximated: `gg`/`dd`/`yy` (a `Chord` is one keystroke), `:42` (`Verb::Reserved` keeps
bare `:` for the command line), and delete (there is no delete-line in a READ pane to bind).

**The order is `user > keyset > OS profile > declared`** (`Keymap.effective_chords`), and that
ranking is the feature. A keyset placed ABOVE a per-verb rebind would mean picking `vim`
silently undid work the operator did in `settings:keys`; below it, a keyset is a better
DEFAULT that a single rebind can still overrule. It is also why `Hotkeys.default_for` — what
the editor's "reset" row reverts to — takes the keyset: reverting to the `x` a verb file
declares would hand a `vim` operator a key their keyset does not use, from a button labelled
"default". Each layer REPLACES rather than merges, and a keyset row keeps `pinned_chords` for
the same reason a user override does: nothing may carry `^Y` off with `y` and leave a pane
with no way to copy in INS.

Two safety properties, both checked rather than argued. `Registry#validate_chords!` now sweeps
the full (OS profile × keyset) matrix, because a keyset substitutes a BUNDLE at once —
`vim` moves fifteen select-line verbs onto `⇧V` in one step — so a verb that later claimed one
of those letters in one of those scopes would shadow silently and only for the operators who
picked that keyset. And `spec/verb/keyset_spec.cr` sweeps the vim bare letters (`u` `/` `a`
`g` `⇧G`) against the eight scopes an editor pane can belong to: the Editor scope sits ahead
of the tab scope, which `validate_chords!` cannot see, so a hit there is a DISPLACEMENT that
must be documented rather than discovered. The one intentional hit is `u` in the Repeater's
read-only response, where Unicode escape display takes priority; the request editor still
resolves `u` in the leading Editor scope to `editor.undo`.

What the keyset deliberately leaves alone: the enable/disable `x` on the four rule lists (that
`x` is a state change, not a selection — KEY_AUDIT F4; since the entry below, all four toggles
are `t` and there is no such `x`), and `intercept.select-line`, which
ships keyless because the Intercept queue spends nearly every letter. A keyset respells keys;
it does not hand one to a pane whose author decided against it.

### 2026-09-12: one bare letter, one question — the settled key grammar

Refines: [P4](#p4). The key-consistency audit's F2/F3/F4/F6/F7, on top of #1050, #1051 and
the first-moves pass (#1054).

gori's bare letters had drifted into meaning different things on tabs a hand moves between in
one gesture. The audit measured it — 586 verbs, 34 scopes, 639 chord bindings — and the answer
is not "one universal per letter" but **one question per letter**, settled below. A new pane
action takes a letter from this table only if it answers that letter's question; otherwise it
starts at L3 (the space menu), which is what the key budget in `docs/content/guide/hotkeys.md`
has always said.

| Key | The question it answers |
|---|---|
| `↵` | show this row **in place** |
| `o` | open this row's own detail — `↵`'s alias, and nothing else (Sitemap is the named exception: `↵` expands a tree node there) |
| `s` | go to the tab this row lives in; where a row has no source, the Global scope lens |
| `d` | delete or dismiss the selected row |
| `y` | copy |
| `t` | flip this row's flag — mark on a list, enable/disable on a rule list |
| `a` | add a new row here |
| `e` | edit the selected row |
| `/` | filter this list |
| `f` | freeze (evidence contexts) · find (the sub-tab strip — a different tier) |
| `r` | send this to the Repeater |
| `^R` | run |
| `w` | swap A ⇄ B |
| `x` | select this line |
| `⇧X` | wipe this tab (asks first) |
| `space` | this tab's command menu |

Three exceptions are deliberate and are documented rather than resolved, because each is a
tab's own loop key and internally coherent:

- **Intercept `f` = forward**, with `⇧F` = forward all. That tab's `f`/`⇧F` family reads as one
  thing, and forwarding is what an operator does there many times a minute.
- **History → Repeater and Repeater send stay `^R`**, which predates this table.
- **The Project ACTIVITY feed's `s` cycles the source chip.** Folding it into that pane's `/`
  bar needs the bar to parse `source:`/`level:`/`actor:`; it is a free-text query handed to
  `events_recent(query:)`, and the chips are separate SQL parameters.

This entry settles the half the two entries above it left open. The keyset one records that
it "deliberately leaves alone… the enable/disable `x` on the four rule lists (that `x` is a
state change, not a selection — KEY_AUDIT F4)" — F4 is settled here, so there is no such `x`
left to leave alone: all four toggles are `t`, and `⇧V` under the vim keyset now reaches a
select-line verb in every editor-capable scope with nothing else wearing the letter.

Two mechanisms keep the table true rather than aspirational. `Registry#validate_chords!` and
`#validate_menu_keys!` run at boot for every OS profile and raise on a same-scope chord
collision, a dead capital-letter chord, or two verbs deriving one space-menu key inside one
displayable view. Neither can see a CONTROLLER arm that claims a letter the registry also
binds — the shape that made four verbs rebindable in the Hotkeys editor and inert in practice
— so `spec/tui/one_key_one_meaning_spec.cr` sweeps every scope per letter, and a body that
declines a key by name is the pattern to copy (`SequencerController#handle_body_key`).

A space-menu **mnemonic** is a different keyspace from a chord: it is reached after `space`, it
need only be unique within one displayable view, and it is a stable action identity. Where a
chord moves and its old letter still reads best in the menu, the letter stays — `probe.open-
evidence` is `s` on the body and `o` in the menu, and both swaps are `w` on the body and `s` in
the menu. What a menu letter must never do is name a key the tab answers differently: that is
why the sub-tab strip's letters and its menu's letters were unified (#1055), and why
`sitemap.tag` gave `T` up to `sitemap.mark-all`.

### 2026-09-17: a slot header copied off the wire is a snapshot, and stays byte-literal

Refines: [P4](#p4), [P7](#p7). Extends the 2026-08-17 *Authorize identities are session slots*
entry. Issue #1086.

A slot could only be built from a login RESPONSE. When the login response set no cookie and
carried no `Authorization`, and the credential was sitting in the authenticated REQUESTS
captured right after it, there was no sanctioned path at all: the operator read the value with
their own eyes and pasted it into an env var. That is the one move an agent client cannot make
— reading a credential into the model's context is exactly what gori's `[REDACTED]` defaults
exist to avoid — so the copy has to happen server-side, from flow to slot, with the value never
crossing a surface.

**The caller names the headers; gori detects nothing.** `create_session_slot{from_request_flow_id,
copy_headers}` and `gori run session from-request <id> --copy-header NAME` copy exactly the
named request headers, last wire field per name, and refuse atomically on a missing name. A
`Cookie:` jar comes across whole or not at all. The alternative — guessing which of
`X-API-Key`, a CSRF pair or a bespoke signature triplet is the credential, and which crumb of a
browser cookie jar is the session — is a heuristic that both over- and under-reaches, and the
operator already knows the answer.

**Three headers are refused by name** (`SessionFromFlow::REFRAMING_HEADERS`): `Content-Length`,
`Transfer-Encoding`, `Host`. A slot is applied to a DIFFERENT message than the one it was
copied from, and the 2026-08-17 entry's first line — the overlay is header-only, so
Content-Length never moves and the body is byte-exact — is exactly what an upserted copy of one
would break. None of the three is a credential, so the refusal costs the feature nothing. It is
a refusal rather than a silent drop: a caller that named one asked for it.

**A captured value is not re-read as syntax.** That is the clause this entry narrows. The
2026-08-17 entry says a `$NAME` inside a slot's own header value resolves against that slot's
table; that holds for the overlay an OPERATOR wrote, and must not hold for bytes gori lifted
off the wire. A session cookie that happens to contain `$BIND.SESSION` is a cookie, not a
reference, and expanding it would send a value the origin never minted — the provenance axis
again (P7: the axis is where the bytes came from, not what they look like). So a slot carries
`literal_headers`, the names whose values came from a flow, and `resolve_values`,
`Env.slot_literals`, and the env-syntax migration all skip them. Both flow-built paths mark
their headers, `from-flow` included: it was always a snapshot of response bytes and the
difference only became visible once a marker existed to state it.

The marker is keyed by header NAME because `overlay_head` upserts by name — for a name typed
twice only the LAST row reaches the wire. The identity form reconstructs the marker from the
displayed text on every save (`AuthorizeIdentityOverlay#surviving_literals`) and keeps it only
while that last row is still the captured bytes: editing it, or adding a hand-written row under
the same name, makes the name manual again. Anything looser sends a hand-written `$BIND.TOKEN`
as its own spelling, which is a 401 whose cause is invisible.

What this deliberately does not do: scope the slot to the flow's host. A slot applies to every
send that names it with `--slot`, host-scoping would be a second scope language beside §3, and
the honest answer for now is that one slot is one identity — said in the CLI banner, the MCP
tool description and the reference docs rather than enforced.


### 2026-09-18: the operator's selection is relayed, not re-derived

Refines: [P4](#p4), [P5](#p5). Extends the 2026-07-26 *verb registry is a TUI concern* entry.
Issue #1091.

An operator who had marked four rows in History could not hand them to an agent. `ui_state`
carried the active tab, the focused pane and ONE cursor flow id, so "do X with what I selected"
ended in reading ids off the screen and pasting them — the exact move the whole MCP surface
exists to remove, and the one an agent cannot make on its own.

**The payload carries the ANSWER of the target rule, never its inputs.** Every batch-capable
verb in the TUI reads one resolver — `Runner#history_target_flow_ids`, `IssuesView#target_ids`,
`SitemapView#target_keys`, `InterceptView#target_ids`, `TabController#target_subtab_indices` —
and each spells the same rule: the marks if any are set, else the cursor row (and, where a
detail overlay is open, the flow it pins, which is what the keys on screen would act on). So the
row publishes `ids` plus `target_source`, and deliberately not a `marked_ids`/`cursor_id` pair
for the reader to combine. A rule re-derived on a second surface is a rule that drifts, and it
would drift first in the case the feature was built for.

**This is the argument the verb registry never had.** The 2026-07-26 entry names the blocker
for reaching the 318 verbs from CLI or MCP: a verb takes its target from TUI selection state
instead of naming it, and what is missing is an argument schema, not registry wiring.
`list_history{ids}` is that argument for the one shape that matters most, supplied through the
`ui_state` facade — the registry stays a TUI concern, and `Tui::` is still not reachable from
`mcp/`.

**Sitemap addresses pairs, so it gets its own key.** A sitemap mark is `{host, path}`, not an
integer, and it reports `nodes` with no `ids` key at all rather than a polymorphic array whose
element type depends on a sibling field. `kind` is what a reader branches on. It carries the raw
mark keys and not `target_endpoints`, which resolves through the current tree and silently drops
a key the tree no longer holds — a narrowing of the operator's selection on its way out.

**The gate is a change detector, not a heartbeat.** What it leaves OUT is as deliberate as
what it holds: the live `/` filter text moves on every keystroke, and including it turned
typing a query into ~3 `settings` commits a second — each one a commit that bumps
`data_version` and makes every watching TUI reload rules, scope and bindings, which is the
churn the 2026-08-27 presence entry gives as its reason for not being a DB row. The visible
row count covers the same ground at the moment the debounced search actually lands, and the
payload still carries the text, read at write time. The same line separates the two mark
counts: the identity reads an O(1) unpruned size (a stale cache key is harmless, and the
prune itself moves it) while the payload prunes, because a phantom there is a lie.

**The publish gate is derived, not counted.** The row is rewritten only when
`Runner#ui_state_identity` moves, and no mark gesture touches any of its four original members —
which is why marking four rows published nothing at all. The added component reads the same
state the payload serialises (`SelectionIdent`: mark count, cursor, visible rows, query, view,
scope lens, marked chips) rather than a revision counter bumped at each of the ~14 mutators.
A counter is an unbounded obligation whose missed bump reproduces exactly this bug, and no
payload spec can see the drift because the payload reads the state and the gate reads the
counter. The audit that makes the derived form sound: in all four views an add only arrives from
a gesture that moves the count, and a removal only from a prune that lowers it. The accepted
residual is named rather than hidden — a reload that leaves count, cursor and row total
identical while sliding one marked row out of the window leaves `marked_hidden_count` stale
until the next gesture, which is a decoration field and self-healing.

**Liveness is evidence, not proof.** A `ui_state` row has no expiry and the TUI writes it only
when the view MOVES, so an old timestamp under a live window means the operator is sitting
still, not that the row is stale. The window marker and `recorded_at` answer different questions
and neither corrects the other: the tool reports both, adds a note when they look like they
disagree, and answers `tui.unknown` rather than `live:false` when it has no database path to
look beside. A selection is capped at 200 ids with `marked_count` kept true and `truncated` said
out loud, and that cap sits under `list_history{ids}`'s own, so a relayed History selection is
always fetchable in one call.

### 2026-09-20: MCP has two eras, and the request says which one

Refines: [P1](#p1). MCP `2026-07-28`.

MCP removed its own handshake. Through `2025-11-25` a session opened with `initialize` and
everything after it inherited the version negotiated there; `2026-07-28` made the protocol
stateless — every request carries its protocol version and the client's capabilities in
`_meta`, every result names a `resultType`, list results carry cache hints, and
`server/discover` is the one RPC a server MUST implement so a client can ask what it is
talking to before it commits. gori now serves both, from one stdio process.

**The era is read per request and never latched.** Under the modern revision there is
nothing to latch it to: the spec is explicit that an open connection is not a session and
that a client may interleave unrelated conversations over one stdio process. `Server#era_of`
reads `_meta` on every request, and the only server-side state left is what it always was —
job handles, OAST sessions, the project binding — each named by an explicit identifier the
client passes back, which is what the statelessness rule actually asks for.

**The era decides the envelope, never what a tool does.** `tools/call` dispatches into the
same handler either way; what changes is `resultType`, the `_meta` server identity and the
cache hints around it. That is deliberate: a second surface for a second revision is a second
thing to keep in step, and [§2](#s2)'s whole argument is that parity survives only
where there is one implementation under the surfaces. A legacy result is byte-identical to
what it was, which is not politeness but the spec's own rule — a missing `resultType` reads as
`complete`.

**A handshake client is answered with a handshake revision, even when it asks for a modern
one.** `initialize` IS the legacy opening; naming `2026-07-28` back would promise per-request
semantics to a client that has already opened a session and has no way to switch. A version
we do not speak is refused with `-32022` and the list we do — and that refusal is load-bearing
in the other direction too: for a dual-era client probing us on stdio, a *recognised* modern
error is how it learns the server is modern and must NOT fall back to `initialize`. Which is
also why `server/discover` is the one request exempted from the metadata gate — answered
when it names no version at all, and when it names one but declares no capabilities:
refusing "tell me what to say" for not having said it first sends that client back to the
handshake for no reason, and a bootstrap probe has nothing to declare yet. The VERSION half
of the gate still applies to it, because that refusal is the signal.

**Cache hints are `private`, and discovery's TTL is zero.** A cached response is keyed by
method plus params, and `{"method":"tools/list"}` is the same key for every gori on the
machine — so `public` would let a shared cache serve one operator's `--tools`-narrowed
catalogue to a different server's client. Nothing there is user-specific; it is
SERVER-specific, which the cache key cannot see. `tools/list` is otherwise cacheable, because the
catalogue is a pure function of the start-up flags — with one exception that the TTL is read
off rather than asserted beside: a read-only server that is still unbound advertises
`create_project` and loses it on the first bind, so while that is ahead of us the answer is
zero. `server/discover` gets `ttlMs: 0` outright, because its `instructions` name the bound
project and `switch_project` moves that mid-session — the same drift `instructions_text`
already warns every client about (#1003), answered here by refusing to let a client cache the
sentence that would go stale.

**What a stateless server may write to stdout closes three doors, and gori walked through
all three.** The revision allows exactly a response, a notification belonging to a request
in flight, and a notification on an acknowledged `subscriptions/listen` stream. A
conformance sweep found gori doing none of those correctly: the `claude/channel` push
(#1090) is a free-running courier frame, so the capability is now declared to the handshake
era only — the socket, Codex-queue, tool-result and poll routes carry the same message off-stream, for
every client, which is why nothing the operator can see is lost. `subscriptions/listen` is
answered rather than refused, with the empty filter the spec asks for when a server supports
no notification type, then closed the way a server closes a stream it is ending itself;
holding it open was never an option, because one worker fiber runs one request at a time and
a stream that never delivers would starve every tool call behind it. And a batch member that
has declared a modern revision is refused, because the array frame does not exist there —
receiving batches stays, since `2025-03-26` made that mandatory and we still advertise it.

**The catalogue may not move, so the one tool that moved it stopped.** `tools/list` "MUST
NOT vary per-connection or as a side effect of other requests on the connection", and
`create_project` was listed on a live `unbound?` — a read-only client that bound a project
lost a tool mid-session. It is now advertised always and refuses at call time, which is
where its gate always was; the listing was only ever telling the client what exists. That
is also what lets the cache hint be a flat number instead of a state-dependent one, and
`spec/mcp/protocol_spec.cr` asserts the invariant rather than a comment claiming it — the
failure is invisible from inside one connection, because the client is holding a list it was
told to trust.

**An unknown tool is a protocol error, and a tool that ran and failed is not.** The spec
names the split and puts "Unknown tool" on the protocol side with the code. gori answered
both with `isError`, which files a name that never reached a tool in the bucket a client is
told to hand back to the model for a retry. The `--tools` refusal moves with it, and its
sentence — written to tell an agent where the rest of the catalogue went — survives as the
error's `message`. What stays a tool result is every code from a tool that actually ran.

**`readOnlyHint` is derived from the gate, with the exceptions spelled.** The hint a client
uses to decide what it may run unattended defaults to `!gated`, because `--read-only` serves
exactly the tools that neither mutate nor dial — one declaration, so the hint and the gate
cannot drift apart. The flag exists for the two populations where they disagree, and is
refused by the macro anywhere it would be redundant: gated READS (`fuzz_status`, `list_jobs`,
`preview_rule` — gated because the workbench they report on is), and ungated WRITERS that
gate themselves (`switch_project`, `create_project`, `probe_scan` whose `active: true` sends,
`oast_poll` which dials and files what it catches, and the two message tools). `read_only`
with `agent_action` is a compile error: an agent action is by definition a mutation or an
outbound send. `openWorldHint` is emitted only where it can be answered — `false` beside a
read tool, and left to the spec's conservative default everywhere else, because an action
tool may or may not reach the network and the population that does includes the fuzzer.

### 2026-09-20: absent is not one thing — a filtered tool and a gated tool differ

Refines: [P1](#p1), [P4](#p4). `--tools` + `instructions`.

`instructions` is the first thing an MCP client hands the model, and it is read as fact. Under
`--tools='list_*'` it named ten tools `tools/list` did not carry, beginning with the sentence
that opens it: "Call ql_reference before writing queries", on a server with no ql_reference.
The mechanism to prevent that already existed and was already used — the operator-messages
note asks `advertises?` before it is appended — it had simply never reached the rest of the
text.

**Every sentence that names a tool is now assembled from the tools that exist**, clause by
clause, and a sentence whose subject is entirely absent is dropped rather than shipped naming
nothing. The backstop for a name added later without that treatment is one sentence that
appears only under a filter: the surface was narrowed on purpose, and `tools/list` is the
authority.

**But `--read-only` is not `--tools`, and the difference is the whole point of that
paragraph.** A gated tool is absent and restorable — saying so is why the read-only sentence
exists, and it legitimately names tools the current listing does not carry. A filtered tool is
absent and not coming back. `Tools#advertises?` reads everything *but* the gate — the `--tools`
filter and the operator's Preferences permission switches (see the 2026-09-27 entry) — which
makes it exactly the predicate for "would this be here if the gate were lifted" — so the
read-only paragraph runs its names through the same call and promises only what a restart
would actually restore.

**And the catalogue's cost is now said out loud on every start.** 179 tools is ~197 KB, about
50,000 tokens an MCP client loads before the first question and keeps for the session;
`--tools` is the lever, and it was announced only to the operators who had already found it.

### 2026-09-20: a cancelled request stops the work, and the tools layer is only ever asked

Refines: [P4](#p4), [P1](#p1). MCP `notifications/cancelled` (#1103).

The spec's MUST for a cancellation ("MUST NOT send any further messages for it") was met and
its two SHOULDs ("stop processing the cancelled request", "free associated resources") were
not. For every short tool that was invisible. For `probe_scan{active:true}` it was the
opposite of P4: a client that had withdrawn its request still had real attack probes sent on
its behalf, up to `PROBE_ACTIVE_MAX_FLOWS` flows of them, and the resource gori was failing to
free was a third party's server. "Cancel and retry" did not work either — the retry queued
behind the run the client had abandoned.

**The seam is a predicate, and it lives on `Tools#call`.** `Server#handle_tools_call` knows
the JSON-RPC id and the tools layer must not learn it, so the transport hands down a
`Proc(Bool)` closed over the key — one optional argument on the one method every tool call
already passes through, rather than a token threaded through 179 handlers that 176 of them
would ignore. It is held for the life of that call and cleared in an `ensure`: the worker
serves one request at a time, so a predicate that outlived its call would answer the next
tool's poll with a previous caller's cancellation. The engines below it take `stop : Proc(Bool)`
or a core-owned token (`Repeater::Minimize::Stop`, which grew a second way to be armed for
callers that can only be asked) and know nothing about MCP — `Probe`, `Repeater` and `Retest`
stay on the core side of §2.1.

**The non-consuming read is a separate method from the consuming one.** `Server#cancelled?`
DELETES the key, because at the write sites it is a one-shot suppression. A running tool
polling that one would clear the flag on its first read and the answer would be written after
all — so `cancel_probe` asks without consuming, and the end-to-end spec asserts the empty
output that pins the difference.

**Which tools stop is a listed decision, not an emergent one.** `probe_scan`,
`minimize_repeater` and `run_retest` poll it; the list on `Tools#call` names them and says why
each of the others does not. Two of those reasons are worth keeping: `cookie_crack` is pure
CPU over a wordlist with no outbound and no yield point, so the reader fiber never runs during
it and the notification is not even parsed until it finishes — a check there would be code
that cannot fire, and what it would be protecting is the operator's own CPU. And the `*_start`
tools are deliberately exempt: they return a `job_id` immediately, so cancelling the call that
started one would suppress the id while the job ran on, which is the opposite of what the
client asked for. `stop_job` is that surface.

**What a stopped run leaves behind is what really happened.** A cancelled request gets no
response at all, so nothing here shapes a partial report — the job is only to stop. A retest's
sends keep their History rows and its run row keeps its `Skipped` remainder (P7: record the
wire; with no answer owed to the caller that row is the operator's only trace). A scan writes
nothing mid-run, and the one thing it does write — the out-of-band promotion — is skipped,
because it exists to put those findings in a report the stopped run does not have. The one
place a stop had to be given a new refusal is `minimize_repeater`'s `apply`: a stop during
calibration aborts, but a stop mid-search returns `aborted: false` with the removals proven so
far, and applying those would rewrite the stored request under a caller who will never learn
the session changed.

### 2026-09-20: a delivery route is ranked by what it can confirm, and a shut door is not the end of the chain

Four routes carry an operator message to an attached agent (#1090), and "best available first"
turned out to name two different orderings. The one that shipped put the `claude/channel` push
at the head because it is the newest and the most native; the ordering that survives review
puts it LAST, because it is the only one that cannot say whether it landed.

**The route that reports back outranks the one that does not.** The inbox socket and `codex
queue` both answer — a write that lands or a CLI that says why not — so either of them retires
the message from the poll backstop (`AgentDelivery::CARRIED`). A channel push to a session that
never registered the channel is dropped without a word. Putting it first meant `mcp.channels`,
an opt-in preview, silently took the socket away from every Claude Code session not launched
with the development-channels flag: the one route that wakes an idle session, traded for a
frame nobody could tell had been discarded. The setting's own description said the push rides
"on top of" the socket; the code said "instead of". Confirmability is what breaks the tie, and
it is the same axis `CARRIED` already uses — the ordering and the retirement rule now read off
one fact instead of two.

**A route that fails falls through; only a route that ANSWERS ends the chain.** The socket
route used to commit on the existence of the path. A path is not a listener:
`/tmp/cc-socks/<pid>.sock` outlives the process that bound it and pids are reused, so a `gori
mcp` under another client can find a dead Claude socket at its parent's pid — and committing to
it cost the `codex queue` hand-off that would have worked. What the failed attempt said is
carried into whatever row does land, because the operator gets one delivery row per message and
a refusal the chain walked away from is otherwise invisible.

**A cursor that only advances when something goes out does not advance.** The tool-result carry
(layer four) computed its next cursor and then discarded it on the `nil` return — the path it
takes on nearly every call. Its idle gate (`high <= @messages_cursor`) therefore never closed
against a feed that grows for any other reason, and the event feed is the firehose every gori
action writes to: each tool call on the surface paid an unindexed `kind = 'agent_message'` walk
of the whole feed rather than the one `MAX(id)` scalar it advertised (0.96ms against 0.005ms
over 50k rows, growing with the project), and five of another session's messages wedged the
layer for good. Advancing a cursor past rows that will never be sent is not marking them
delivered — nothing is emitted on that path, so there is nothing a failed emit could take back.
The courier and `operator_messages` had the rule right; the third reader of the same feed did
not, which is the argument for `each_event_of_kind` owning it.

### 2026-09-21: an empty gori upstream adopts the process proxy convention

Refines: [P4](#p4), [P5](#p5). Issue #1114.

`network.upstream_proxy` being blank used to mean that every gori-owned dial was direct, even
when the process had been launched with `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, or `ALL_PROXY`. That is a
surprising split from the command-line tools gori is commonly run beside, and it made a
container or a corporate workstation silently bypass its required egress proxy.

**The environment is a last-resort route, not a second settings table.** The existing
operator-owned decision remains the authority: project destination gates, project pins, the
ordered `upstream_rules` table (including `direct`), and a non-empty global scalar all win
before the environment is consulted. Only an empty global scalar reaches the environment
fallback, and `NO_PROXY` / `no_proxy` is applied there. This keeps a deliberate gori exception
from being overridden by ambient process state while still making an unconfigured install
behave like its surrounding tools.

**The original scheme is part of the route query.** HTTP origins choose `HTTP_PROXY` and then
`ALL_PROXY`; HTTPS origins choose `HTTPS_PROXY`, `HTTP_PROXY`, and then `ALL_PROXY`, with
uppercase names preferred over their lowercase compatibility spellings. The dialer carries
the origin scheme to the one `Settings.upstream_route` seam so the capture path, engines,
updater, and OAST traffic do not each invent a precedence rule. A malformed selected value is
an invalid route and fails closed; it never silently falls through to a direct origin.

**Environment URL schemes follow the established convention only at that boundary.** An
environment `http://` value is a plaintext HTTP CONNECT hop and `https://` means TLS to that
proxy; credentials in process URI userinfo are accepted because they are not persisted. The
persisted `network.upstream_proxy` `https://` spelling remains the historical plaintext form,
so adopting the convention cannot reinterpret an existing settings file.

**Loopback is direct before `NO_PROXY` is read.** `localhost` and any loopback or unspecified
address literal (`127.0.0.0/8`, `::1`, `0.0.0.0`, `::`) never take the environment route, whether
or not `NO_PROXY` names them — the same answer Go's `httpproxy` and curl give. A profile that
exports `HTTP_PROXY` for the corporate egress does not mean "send my own machine's traffic
there", and doing so both failed every local test and disclosed the local request-target to a
third party. It keys on the DESTINATION only — a proxy that itself sits on `127.0.0.1` is still
used for a remote target — and it holds on every dial, the TLS passthrough relay and the blind
CONNECT tunnel included: those now ask for the TLS origin's variable, and a loopback target
still answers "direct" before that variable is read. The carve-out belongs to the environment
arm only: a rule, scalar, or project pin that routes loopback through a proxy is an operator
decision and still wins.

### 2026-09-22: the MCP surface answers about itself before it answers about the project

Refines: [P1](#p1), [P4](#p4). Issues #1136, #1138, #1140, #1142.

Four defects found by driving the stdio server directly, and one shape under all of them: a
question about the *call* was answered as though it were a question about the *data*.

**The envelope is checked before the message is read as one.** `handle_message` looked at
`method` and nothing else, so `{"jsonrpc":"1.0"}`, a message carrying no version member at
all, and ids of every JSON shape were executed — and answered in a `"jsonrpc":"2.0"` frame,
which rewrites the client's message into one it never sent and teaches a client that ships a
serialisation bug that it speaks 2.0. `envelope_error` is the one predicate, read by the
reader's `ping` fast path and by the worker, so the two fibers cannot disagree about what a
request is. An id the spec does not allow is answered at `null` (the spec's own rule for a
request whose id cannot be determined); a legal id is echoed, because a client is holding a
promise for it.

**A schema that omits `additionalProperties` is a promise the validator breaks.** gori refuses
any undeclared argument — a mistyped `verbatm:true` left `verbatim` off and the caller measured
a request it never sent — while all 179 root schemas said, in JSON Schema, that extras were
fine. The client was handed one contract and scored against another, so a typo it could have
caught locally travelled to the server instead. `additionalProperties: false` now closes them.

**The `_`-prefixed exemption is honoured and not advertised, and that asymmetry is the
point.** Spelling it in the schema needs `patternProperties`, which is outside the JSON Schema
subset several clients accept when they convert an MCP `inputSchema` into their provider's
tool schema — one unparseable keyword on all 179 tools costs such a client the whole
catalogue, to promise an extension MCP puts in `params._meta` rather than in
`params.arguments`. So the validator stays the more PERMISSIVE of the two. Only one direction
of disagreement can hurt a caller: a schema that promises more than the validator accepts
sends a legal-looking call to its refusal, while a validator that accepts more than the
schema promised can never surprise a caller who followed the schema.

**What the name IS comes before whether a project is bound.** `Tools#call` ran the unbound
gate first, so on an unbound server a typo and a tool `--tools` had hidden both came back
"no project bound" — masking a protocol error, and sending the agent to bind a project so it
could retry a call that was never going to exist. `UNKNOWN_TOOL` is a protocol error (the
transport turns it into -32602, per the 2026-09-20 entry above); `NO_PROJECT` is a tool result
the model is meant to act on. Classify the name, then gate the project.

**And the recovery out of the unbound state follows the filter, like every other sentence.**
The 2026-09-20 entry made `instructions` name only the tools `tools/list` carries; the
`NO_PROJECT` error, `project_info`'s note, the two tool descriptions that point at a binder,
and the startup log were all still naming three fixed tools. `Tools#project_recovery` is the
one home, and `instructions` appends the same words rather than dropping the sentence, so the
first text the model reads and the error it hits ten calls later do not disagree.

**A lister is not a binder.** The recovery set is `list_projects, create_project,
switch_project`, but only the last two BIND: `list_projects` reads a page and changes nothing.
A server that serves it alone can therefore hand the agent every project's name and then
refuse every one of them — the same retry loop, entered from the other side — so
`unbindable?` asks for a PICKER (`Tools::PROJECT_PICKERS`), not for any of the three.
`Server#unbound_note` had always drawn that line in prose ("list_projects to see available
projects" against the two that "pick"); it is now the predicate as well. When no picker is
served the honest answer is that the recovery is not in the agent's hands at all — the
operator has to restart — and that is said once at start-up on stderr, from both unbound
entry points (`--no-project` and the degrade-to-unbound path a bad database takes), because
stderr is the only surface the operator who made the mistake is looking at.

### 2026-09-23: the catalogue's weight is measured, not written down, and a profile is a list of names

Refines: [P4](#p4). `--tools` profiles, #1137.

Every number gori had written about its own MCP catalogue was wrong by the time #1137 measured
it: the guide said about 160 tools, and 53 under `--read-only`, of a 179/62 registry; the
`--tools` help and two comments said ~43k tokens of a `tools/list` past 200 KB. A size compiled
into help text or prose drifts the moment a tool lands. So the weight is measured where it is
spent: `gori mcp` builds the listing it is about to serve (`Tools.catalogue_json`, on a storeless
instance — exact, because the listing may not vary with the connection) and logs its size on
every start. The guide keeps one table of counts and sizes, and
`spec/mcp/catalogue_size_spec.cr` fails when a row drifts from the build.

**The full catalogue stays the default.** Narrowing it is a trade the operator makes, and a
default that hid the workbench would read to an agent exactly like a gori without it — the
failure `--tools` already refuses to produce by accident.

**A profile is a list of names, never a glob.** `--tools=@recon` and `@minimal` resolve inside
the same spec grammar, so they compose (`@minimal,send_request`, `-@recon`). A glob would let a
profile grow with the registry — `list_*` gains every new lister — which is the silent growth
#1137 was filed about, moved inside the lever meant to contain it. A tool joins a profile by
being written into `ToolFilter::PROFILES`. Every profile keeps both project pickers, since
`switch_project` has nothing to switch to on a host with no project yet (#1136), and a
member's description may not send the agent to a tool the profile leaves out: the model reads
it as fact, and each such pointer is a call spent on `UNKNOWN_TOOL`. The spec holds the
exceptions — mentions that are not instructions — in a list with a reason each.

### 2026-09-23: a command that names one setting pins it; a card saved whole folds

`gori run project network set KEY VALUE` (#1115) writes the same `net.*` rows as the TUI's
Project settings card, and deliberately does NOT share the card's rule that a value equal to
the global is stored as "inherit". The card needs that rule: it is saved whole from what it
displayed, so it cannot tell a value the operator typed from an inherited one left alone, and
without the fold every save would freeze a copy of the global into the project. A command
that names one key has no such ambiguity — `set` says pin, `unset` says inherit — and folding
there is wrong in one case that matters: an empty `upstream_proxy` is a DIRECT pin, while
"inherit" still lets `upstream_rules` and `HTTPS_PROXY` route the project through a proxy. So
the command pins and says so when the pin equals the global; the card keeps folding.

Both surfaces keep the one invariant that is about safety rather than ergonomics: credentials
pin the upstream they were validated against, in the same write (`set_settings`), so a busy
store cannot leave a password beside an address it was never entered for.

**A per-send override edits the send, not the session.** `repeater send --path` (#1116) sends
the session's request to another target and leaves the stored request AND its last response
alone: storing another endpoint's answer beside the row would show the tab a response to a
request it does not hold, and make the next `--diff` compare against the wrong endpoint. The
same line holds for `--headers-only` / `--max-body` (#1119): they shape what is printed, never
what is sent, stored or recorded.

### 2026-09-23: a generated User-Agent follows the handshake it rides on, and a header set is not a token

`$GEN.USER_AGENT` (#1112) drew from every browser alike, so with the `chrome` TLS preset most
sends claimed Firefox or Safari over a Chrome-shaped ClientHello, the mismatch bot management
keys on first. #1153 narrows the plain name to the family of the preset the dial will really
use: the send's own override (#844) when it has one, else the destination's `outbound_tls`
rule, judged on the dialed host exactly as `Upstream.dial_tls_result` judges it. It applies to
`https`/`wss` only, and `curl` or no preset leaves the whole list. The explicit
`USER_AGENT_CHROME`/`_FIREFOX`/`_SAFARI` names stay the operator's choice. The narrowing
never leaves the list in force: with an operator list (#1154) that has none of the preset's
browser, the plain name keeps drawing from the whole operator list. An engagement may require
an identifying UA, and the plain name promised the operator's list, not a browser.

The mint happens before the dial, so the send path has to carry the dial to it:
`Env::Generation.for_dial(host, scheme, tls_preset)`, used by Repeater, Fuzz (and so Authorize,
Miner, Sequencer and Probe through `Fuzz::Sender`), Discover and Intercept. The failure the
issue named is a *forgotten* site, which is silent: one leftover `Generation.new` on a send
path mints a Firefox UA over a Chrome hello and no test notices. So
`spec/send_seam_generation_spec.cr` sweeps `src/gori` and holds every dial-less construction to
a named reason and count, and every send-side expansion to a passed context, the same shape
as the stdin-door sweep. The family is resolved lazily, so a fuzz run that never names the
token never pays the preset lookup.

`Sec-CH-UA` stays out of `$GEN`. Chromium sends it; Firefox and Safari do not send the header
at all. A token can change a value but cannot delete the line it sits on, so `sec-ch-ua:
$GEN.…` is wrong for two of the three families whatever it mints. And its brand list carries
Chromium's per-major GREASE entry, which gori would have to reproduce exactly rather than
approximate. If gori grows client hints, they belong to the TLS preset, as a header set the
preset owns and emits only when it is a Chromium one.

### 2026-09-23: the `chrome` preset owns its client hints, read off the User-Agent the request carries

#1174 answers the header-set question the #1153 entry left open. Under the `chrome` preset
(the send's override, else the destination rule, resolved as `$GEN.USER_AGENT` resolves it),
every gori-originated `https` request gets the three low-entropy hints Chrome sends by default:
`sec-ch-ua`, `sec-ch-ua-mobile`, `sec-ch-ua-platform`. The issue's three questions:

**Where it is applied.** At the send seam, on the final bytes: `Env.client_hints` runs after
`$NAME` expansion and after the slot overlay, as the last header-only pass. It does not mint
beside `$GEN.USER_AGENT`. It reads whatever User-Agent the request carries at that point, a
`$GEN` mint, the slot's header or a literal, and derives the brand list's seed and version
from that UA's own major. The two cannot disagree, because one is computed from the other.
Every seam that calls `overlay_slot` also calls `client_hints`, and
`spec/send_seam_generation_spec.cr` holds the two counts equal per file. The one named
exception is the intercept forward: those are a client's own bytes on the proxy path, and a
browser that sent no hints must not gain them in transit. Field-native h2 sends take neither
pass, for the reason `Sender#send_fields` gives. The preset lookup runs only once the head
contains `Chrome/` at all, so a run that never sends a Chrome UA still never pays for it,
which keeps the promise the #1153 entry made about lazy resolution.

**Operator bytes win (P7).** A request that already has any `sec-ch-ua*` header (including a
high-entropy one) belongs to the operator, and gori adds nothing beside it. Completing a
partial set would mix two sources in one header family. A typed User-Agent is never touched;
the hints follow it. There is no mismatch warning. gori-written hints cannot mismatch, so the
only possible mismatch is between hints and a UA the operator typed, and that may be the test
itself (probing a UA/client-hint consistency check). Under the `chrome` preset, a User-Agent
of another browser gets no hints. The handshake/UA disagreement it shows is #1153's open
warning question, and a per-send warning across a fuzz run would be noise, not signal.

**Where the algorithm comes from.** It is ported from Chromium at
`ab1ade5d1fa5f1c0b2bf80ab48d9b9cb25aa3c95` (`components/embedder_support/user_agent_utils.cc`:
GREASE brand, stable shuffle, platform; `base/version_info/version_info.h`: OS names; blink's
`user_agent_metadata.cc`: RFC 8941 serialization). The spec replays the vectors from that
revision's `user_agent_utils_unittest.cc`, not from captures: a capture shows the output for
one seed, and the unit tests pin the function itself. Faithfulness decides what gets no
hints: only a UA in the exact shape Chrome's `BuildUserAgentFromOSAndProduct` writes counts.
Edge, Opera and other Chromium browsers append a product token and send a brand their own
code chooses, which Chromium's source does not state, so they get none. That includes the
built-in corpus's Edge line. A WebSocket handshake gets none either, because Chromium's
source does not establish that hints are sent there. Header names are lowercase and go
immediately before `User-Agent`, the order Chrome uses on a navigation.

### 2026-09-23: a report that leaves the machine redacts credential headers; an interchange document does not

`gori run issues --format sarif` (and the TUI's SARIF export) writes `Authorization`,
`Cookie`, `Set-Cookie` and the API-key headers as `[REDACTED]` unless `--include-sensitive`
is passed (#1191). The line is the one #1002 drew for `history --format json`: a structured
document meant for another system (a code-scanning upload, a CI artifact, a dashboard) takes
the redacted default, and HAR stays verbatim because an interchange document has to carry the
message in full to be replayed. SARIF cannot replay anything, since its `headers` object
already combines repeated fields, so it belongs on the redacted side. The predicate moved to
`Redact.sensitive_header?` (redact/headers.cr) so the exporter asks the same list as MCP and
the CLI without depending on a surface. The TUI export has no opt-in, the same choice its
evidence export makes. The Markdown issue report still embeds each linked flow's head
verbatim. It is a human-readable report rather than a machine feed, and changing it is a
separate decision.

### 2026-09-24: a search across projects reads each database raw and read-only, never through `Store.open`

Refines: [P5](#p5), [P6](#p6). #1229.

The picker's `^F` searches the captured flows of every registered project (`Gori::ProjectSearch`),
so an explicit search now opens project databases, which the picker's render path still never
does (see 2026-08-27). `Store.open` is the facade P5 names, and it is the wrong door here even
with `read_only: true`: it still migrates a stale schema and refuses a newer one, and a host with
hundreds of projects spans a dozen schema versions, so one keystroke would have migrated most of
them. The search goes around it in the one direction that cannot change state. Each database is
opened through the C API with `SQLITE_OPEN_READONLY`, because the shard hardcodes
`READWRITE | CREATE` and ignores `mode=ro`, and only the `flows` columns and `flows_fts` that V1
created are queried, plus V4's `fts_dirty` where it exists, so the bodies the index has not reached
yet are scanned under the indexer's own rule (`Store.body_fts_text`). A read-write connection is not a reader, since closing the last one
checkpoints the WAL into the db file. A READONLY one never does, which was measured against a live
writer and a crashed session's WAL on macOS and Linux. The exception is a WAL database with no
`-wal` beside it, a cleanly closed project on Linux, where READONLY creates a fresh `-wal` stamped
now and `Project#last_modified` would reorder every project list around the search. That shape is
read with `immutable=1`, chosen from the file header rather than from a failed open, and re-read
once if the file changed during the read. The work is cooperative (P6): one database at a time, a
`QueryControl` progress handler so a keystroke cancels mid-query, and a 100 ms busy budget rather
than the store's five seconds, because SQLite's busy wait blocks the single-threaded scheduler.

### 2026-09-24: a gori shell is one terminal's environment, and gori does not adopt its own injection

Refines: [P4](#p4), the 2026-09-21 entry. #1238.

`gori run shell` and the palette's **Open shell** point one terminal's tools at gori (`Gori::ShellEnv`),
the way **Open browser** points one browser. Nothing global changes. The proxy variables and the
trust variables live in that shell, and the only file written is a CA bundle under `~/.gori/shell/`.

**The bundle keeps what the terminal already trusted.** Most trust variables (`SSL_CERT_FILE`,
`CURL_CA_BUNDLE`, `GIT_SSL_CAINFO`, …) replace a tool's store rather than add to it, so pointing
them at gori's root alone breaks every host gori does not intercept. The bundle is the operator's
own `SSL_CERT_FILE` (else the system roots) plus gori's root, named by the hash of its content.
A regenerated CA, an updated system store or a different enterprise bundle therefore gets a new
file rather than a stale one, and a bundle that already holds the root is reused as it is. A CA
variable the terminal set for one tool keeps its own base in the same way.

**The address comes from the capture, not from settings.** The CLI reads `CaptureStatus` only
while the capture lock is held, because the live port can differ from the configured one after a
fallback. The marker now also records the CA the session signs with, since `--ca-dir` is chosen
per process and another process cannot derive it.

**The environment arm skips a value a gori shell exported.** A gori started inside the shell would
otherwise adopt the parent as its upstream through the 2026-09-21 fallback, and every request it
made would be captured twice. Only the exact value the shell wrote (`GORI_SHELL=1` plus
`GORI_PROXY`) is skipped. An explicit rule, scalar or project pin still chains on purpose. The
shell records what it replaced or unset as `GORI_SHELL_ORIG_<NAME>`, and the environment arm falls
back to that record, so a nested gori still reaches the terminal's own egress proxy and its
`NO_PROXY`. A shell opened inside a shell starts its trust from the same record rather than from
the outer bundle, which would otherwise keep the outer gori's root trusted.

**The TUI hands its terminal to `gori run shell`, not to `$SHELL`.** Crystal's runtime ignores
SIGPIPE, and an ignored signal survives `exec`. A shell spawned directly passed that on to every
pipeline, so `yes | head` printed "Broken pipe". The CLI resets it right before its own `exec`.
The handoff also uses termisu's `full_cooked` rather than `suspend`'s cooked mode, which leaves
OPOST and ICRNL off. An editor sets its own termios and never noticed, but a shell passes that
state to every command it runs. Open shell here is refused while intercept is on, because held
requests are released from a screen the shell is covering.

### 2026-09-24: a pasted curl command is operator bytes read with curl's meaning, minus curl's own identity

Refines: [P7](#p7). #1244.

A curl command an operator pastes (Repeater → Paste cURL, Import: cURL, `--curl`, MCP `curl`) is
theirs, so it is read with curl's meaning of every flag, measured against curl 8.7.1 on a raw
listener, and not with `gori run send`'s. The two disagree on `-b`, which is a cookie in curl and
a body in `send`, and Chrome's "Copy as cURL" emits cookies with `-b`. Where curl sends the bytes
as typed, so does the import: a `-H` line keeps its spacing and its argv position, a CR/LF inside
`-H` or `-X` goes out as written (curl does the same), and a stated `Content-Length` stays beside a
longer body. Where curl REFUSES, so does the import, for example on whitespace or a control byte in
the URL. `--request-target` is curl's own verbatim door and is honoured. Two things are left out on
purpose. curl's `User-Agent: curl/…` and `Accept: */*` describe the client that ran the command,
not the request the command describes, and keeping them would break the export round trip,
because a capture with no User-Agent exports with no `-H` for one. Transport flags (`-k`, `-x`,
`-L`, `--resolve`) are ignored and named, since gori dials through its own settings. The
round trip `Export::Curl` → `Import::Curl` returning the same bytes is the contract
(`spec/curl_round_trip_spec.cr`). Holding the export to it found two cases where running the
exported command sent something other than the capture: curl collapses `..` path segments and
adds a form Content-Type to a body that had none. The export now writes `--path-as-is` and
`-H 'Content-Type:'` for those cases.

### 2026-09-24: unknown rewrite labels stay inert until this binary understands them

#1242. A settings file or project database may have been written by a newer gori. Project
databases have no constraint on the rewriter enum columns, and settings parsing historically
clamped an unrecognised label to that field's live default. Thus a future `short_circuit` op
could become `replace` in an older binary and rewrite traffic. Keep each raw label beside its
total enum projection in `MatchRule`; `inert?` is the shared gate for replacement and
short-circuit selection. Settings saves retain the raw strings, non-string values and unrecognised extra keys, keeping those rows inert so newer fields do not widen matching, and reordering any inert neighbour is refused in both scopes. TUI, CLI and MCP list the raw
labels and explain the unsupported fields; they refuse to edit, duplicate, reorder or enable such a rule while
allowing deletion. Unknown ops count as might-execute so profile import requires `--allow-commands`. The scope is the rewriter grammar fields (`target`, `part`, `op`, and
`match_kind`), plus unrecognised keys on settings rules, so the guard also covers a label added to an existing enum.

### 2026-09-24: a fuzz run can end itself, and the archive need not keep every row

#1240. Refines [P4](#p4) (the operator decides what leaves the machine) and [P6](#p6). Two
additions, both surface-neutral through `Plan.build`.

`stop_on` lets a run end when its work is done rather than when the payloads run out: a match
count (`Config#stop_after_matches`) or a SEPARATE match/filter condition
(`Matcher#stop_condition`). The condition is a `Matcher` used as a spec container, never
`build`-called — `Matcher#build` evaluates it through `matches_precomputed?` on the same
decoded body/text/metrics it computed for the run's own verdict, so a stop condition costs no
second decode. The trigger is `Engine#record_result`, the one bookkeeping path `worker_loop`
and `run_race` share, and it is exactly `stop`: in-flight requests finish. An operator stop
that lands first wins: an in-flight row meeting the condition afterwards is still flagged
`stop_hit`, but the verdict stays `stopped`. "Stop when the body
no longer says `Invalid password`" is a condition with only a filter regex — the matcher's
existing way of expressing absence. Calibration sends are not results, so they never trip it.
A new terminal verdict `Terminal::ConditionMet` names the ending; it is an enum so a consumer
`case`s it exhaustively rather than mapping an unknown string to `:error`. The CLI exits 0 on
it (the condition was the goal), and race mode refuses the pair (`StopOnError`): a race group
is released in one write, with no per-response verdict to fire on.

`keep: interesting` (`Fuzz::Keep`) filters the ARCHIVE only — the CLI/MCP saved run and the
TUI spool behind Shift-S — never the live pane or MCP's live cache. It keeps the rows
`Result#interesting?` names (matched, plus error/chain-error/re-send/incomplete/stop rows),
the one predicate every retention decision reads so the surfaces cannot drift on "interesting".
The run's counters stay whole-run and `idx` stays the engine's payload index, so a kept row
holds its real position and the gaps are the dropped rows; `fuzz_runs.keep` records the policy
so a filtered archive reads "12 of 100,000 kept" instead of a lost run. Pause-on-condition is
deliberately left out: it needs a plain pause verb first, and the engine's pause still drains
the worker buffer (`Engine#pause` parks only the dispatcher).
### 2026-09-24: JSON Unicode decoding is a view, and `u` belongs to the read-only response

Refines: [P4](#p4), [P7](#p7). #1248.

Pretty-printing a request is a write-back action, so it only adds JSON whitespace. It must keep
string escape spellings, duplicate members, number tokens, lone surrogates and even invalid
UTF-8 bytes inside strings as the operator entered them. The response and History detail have
a separate `u` view toggle: it decodes valid `\\uXXXX` escapes for display, marks the decoded
ranges, and leaves the captured bytes and copy/search data untouched. Hidden Unicode and
control characters render as named badges, with emoji joiners/selectors retained in context.

In the Repeater, the response is read-only and outside `Scope::Editor`, so its default `u`
action occupies that tab-scope chord; the request editor remains in `Scope::Editor`, where
vim's `u` still means undo. An explicit user rebind wins over that default in keymap collision
resolution. The English and Korean hotkey guides and `spec/verb/keyset_spec.cr` record this
cross-scope exception.

### 2026-09-25: response mocking is a short-circuit sub-kind, and map-local is its one fall-through

#1237 grows the #511 stub into a directory (Map Local), a snapshot of a captured response, and
close/reset/hang faults with a delay. They are a `respond` sub-kind of `op = short_circuit`
(`match_rules.respond`/`respond_args`, V33), not new `RuleOp` members. An older binary reads an
unknown op as inert only since #1242. It reads a `dir` row as a stub whose body file is a
directory, and a `fault` row as a stub with an empty head, and every release since #511 answers
both with the 502 stub. A `respond` label or `respond_args` key this binary does not know keeps
the row inert, on the #1242 terms.

The request path of a `dir` rule is the client's bytes naming a local file, which is a new sink.
It is confined rather than repaired or passed through ([P7](#p7) governs the wire, not the
filesystem). The path is percent-decoded once. Dot segments, dotfiles, NUL and backslash are
refused before any filesystem call. The file's realpath must sit under the root's. A refusal is
a recorded 404 and never reaches the origin.

"A claimed request never reaches the origin" gains exactly one exception: a `dir` rule with
`fallthrough`, for a file that is simply absent. It declines at claim time, before anything is
answered or dialed, and the next rule (or the origin) takes the request. A refused path, a
missing root and every other sub-kind still fail closed.

A delay and a hang pin a fiber, an fd and an accept slot, so they are bounded twice ([P6](#p6)):
120 s per wait, and 256 held connections process-wide. Past the cap a hang closes at once, a
delay is skipped, and the flow says which. The rule that answered is recorded as text in
`flows.source_ref`, so a mocked response stays attributable after the rule is edited or
deleted. A mock from History is a decoded snapshot, never a reference, because flow ids are
reused.

### 2026-09-25: a saved fuzz run points at its stop row; the engine names it, not the rows

#1270. Completes the #1240 entry above. A `condition_met` run now records which result tripped
it as `fuzz_runs.stop_idx` (V34), carried from `Engine#check_stop_condition` on
`DoneEvent#stop_index` and written by the checked terminal update — only on a `condition_met`
finish, and only when the run's own archive holds that `idx`, so a `save_failed`/`stopped` run
never points at evidence that is not there.

One run-level pointer, not a per-row `stop_hit` column, because the rows cannot say which of
them it was. An `after_matches` stop trips on a plain match whose `stop_hit?` is false; with
concurrency, in-flight rows that finish after the stop can meet the condition too, so the
lowest flagged `idx` is not the row that fired; and an operator stop that lands first leaves a
flagged row on a run with no stop at all. Only the engine sees the ordering, so it names the
row — and `record_result` judges it BEFORE the blocking `ResultEvent` send, with no yield since
`@matched` moved, or a worker parked on a full event buffer resumes to read another worker's
match as its own Nth. Every surface reads the run's field: the TUI marks the row whose index matches
(`FuzzerView#stop_row?`, live and reopened alike), the CLI and MCP print/emit `stop_index`.
The live per-row `stop_hit` flag stays live-only. A run saved before V34 reads NULL — not
recorded — and nothing backfills it, for the same three reasons.

### 2026-09-25: JavaScript references are derived rows, never flows, and a scan marker is per flow

Refines: [P3](#p3), [P4](#p4), [P6](#p6), [P7](#p7). #1243.

`JsRefs` reads endpoint literals out of JS responses and inline scripts already in the store and
persists them in `js_refs` (V35). They are NOT written as flows, not even Pending ones: a flow
reads as "a request was attempted" in History, QL, HAR and the OpenAPI export, and nothing was
sent. They attach to the Sitemap at the tree level only (`Sitemap.attach_js_refs!`, after the
build and before tags and folds) and never through `Store#sitemap_entries`, so every consumer
of the traffic read — OpenAPI, `Diff`, `representative_flow_id`, tag confirmation — stays
traffic-only, and a reference node never carries a method, so every "N paths" count is still
a count of traffic.

Persisting was chosen over the parameter inventory's recompute-per-read because the tree reloads
on every data_version tick and re-lexing megabyte bundles per reload is the cost the inventory
avoids only by being asked rarely. The rows are projections of their flow's body and are
deleted with it in all four delete paths (`delete_flow_one`, `clear_flows`, `Store#prune`,
`prune_old_flows`). Which flows were scanned is a per-flow marker (`js_ref_scans`), not a
watermark: `flows.id` was a reused rowid before V39, so after a `history clear` new captures got ids below
any "scanned up to" mark. The marker carries the extractor's `VERSION`, so changing extraction
rescans without a migration, and it is written in the same transaction as the flow's rows, so
a rolled-back batch leaves the flow unscanned rather than marked done with nothing.

A literal is page-authored bytes: it resolves through `Url.resolve`/`Url.parse` and
`Headers.safe_url?`, like a crawled href (a separator is encoded, CR/LF is refused). A
root-relative literal in an external script resolves against the page its captured request's
`Referer` names, and against the script's own origin — flagged `guessed` — only without one.
Everything that passes those filters is stored, and scope and host visibility are applied at
READ time, because a reference dropped at scan time could never come back once its flow is
marked scanned. The host rule: a host the project has traffic for is shown; one it never
captured is shown only when a scope include names it, which keeps a bundle's `www.w3.org`
namespaces out of the tree without a hard-coded denylist.

The scan is on demand only for now; a background mode on the Analyzer's passive fiber would tie
references to the Probe mode, where "off" would silently mean "no references". Relative
literals without a leading `/`, `.map`/JSON bodies, and copying the page's credentials into a
Repeater request built from a reference are all left out on purpose.

### 2026-09-25: a session slot refreshes itself before a send, never after a response

#1233. A slot was a static snapshot and said so ("No auto-login … gori acting behind the
operator's back (P4)"), so a long Fuzz, Authorize, Retest or agent run went on after the token
expired and collected 401s. A slot now carries `refresh` (Repeater session ids, in order) and
`refresh_before` (`off` | `jwt-exp` | `ttl=`), and `Gori::SessionRefresh` replays the steps —
by hand, or before a send the policy says is due. This narrows the old refusal rather than
reversing it: gori runs only requests the operator put in the slot's list, under a policy the
operator set on it, and every one is logged (History `src:refresh`, one `session` event, the
`⟳`/`!` chip). What gori still never does is decide from a RESPONSE that it should log in
again. Retry-after-401 is out because it produces wrong answers, not just complexity: in
Authorize the 401 is the verdict, a fuzz row would stand for two requests, race mode cannot
retry, and a refresh that itself 401s needs loop protection against an account lockout.

- **A step is sent AS the slot, not by activating it.** `activate` is process-global and would
  hand every in-flight send in another tab the refreshing identity. `PlanOptions#refresh_slot`
  resolves the step's `$BIND.*` from that slot's table (`Env.expand_bindings(as_slot:)`),
  observes its response into that table (`Bindings#observe(as_slot:)`), and writes no overlay —
  the login must not carry the stale credential it replaces (open question 1: no overlay).
- **The before-send hook is asked for every identity a send goes out as** (open question 2):
  the active slot at `Repeater::Sender#wire`, every `Fuzz::Sender` send (race: before the group
  is dialled), Discover, the Miner hook backend — and each Authorize identity by name in
  `send_one`, since that sender wears no active slot. It lives in a leaf
  (`session_refresh/hook.cr`) so the send seams do not depend on the Repeater, and it answers
  only while its binding table is `Env.layer`, so a hook a closed project left behind is inert.
  An automatic refresh uses the SURFACE's gate (`Outbound.interactive`/`.cli`/`.agent`) and
  never inherits a send's own waiver; a manual one may pass its own.
- **Failure never blocks the send and never repeats quickly** (open question 3): single-flight
  per slot (a closed `Channel` wakes every waiter; no `-Dpreview_mt`, so a latch is enough), a
  30 s cooldown after a failure, automatic refresh off after 3 in a row until a manual refresh
  succeeds. A slot whose last refresh failed is due again after its cooldown whatever its
  policy reads: a TTL counted from a step-1 CSRF that DID rebind would otherwise call the slot
  fresh while its session token stayed stale — which is also why a TTL counts from the last
  SUCCESSFUL refresh, or before one from the OLDEST claimed binding, never the newest. A
  refresh whose steps all answered but rebound none of the slot's claimed bindings, or that
  leaves a `jwt-exp` slot still inside its skew, counts as a failure: "succeeded but still due"
  is a login before every send with no cooldown in front of it.
- **Never on the TUI's event loop.** A before-send refresh asked from the UI fiber
  (`SessionRefresh.ui_fiber`) runs on a fiber of its own and that one send goes out with the
  value it has; the Repeater's send takes `wire_bytes` on its send fiber so the common path
  waits for the fresh value there. An automatic refresh re-reads the slot list first, so a
  step whose tab was closed is refused rather than resolved to whatever took its id.
- **A `gori run` command reads through a read-only store**, so a refresh there writes its
  History rows and event through a writable handle the same project already holds, or holds
  them for the next writable open of that project (`hand_over`, keyed on the database path) —
  never into another project's.
- **A deleted step detaches, it does not re-bind.** `Store#delete_repeater` negates the id in
  the slot blob in the same transaction (#1160's encoding), editing the JSON in place so a key
  this build does not know survives. `SessionSlots#reload` prunes per-slot binding tables only
  when an IDENTITY field moved (`SessionSlot#same_identity?`), or closing a step's tab would
  have wiped every slot's live token in every process.
- **Per process**, like the values themselves: a TUI refresh does not update a running
  `gori mcp`, and `gori run session refresh` rebinds a table that ends with the command.

### 2026-09-25: a menu outside the registry borrows the app's letters

Refines: [P1](#p1). #1274.

The Project Picker runs before any project is open, so its space menu is a hand-rolled table
rather than registry verbs. It had drifted into its own dialect: rename `r`, export `e`, clear
marks `n`, letters matched case-blind, an unmapped key ignored, and Import jumping behind
Delete once marks were set. An operator learns one set of mnemonics, so a menu outside the
registry spells a shared intent with the app's letter (rename `e`, export `E`, clear marks `N`,
delete `d`, open `o`), matches case-sensitively, dismisses on an unmapped key with the same
j/k/h/l fallback, and keeps one row order whether or not marks exist, with the destructive
entry last. Caps Lock no longer reaches the picker's lower-case entries, as it never did in the
app. `ProjectPicker.space_entries` and `.space_key` are pure so `spec/tui/project_marks_spec.cr`
can pin the letters.

### 2026-09-25: a space-menu letter is checked against every key its tab answers first

Refines: the 2026-09-12 entry above. #1274 WP0.

That entry's rule — a menu letter must never name a key the tab answers differently — had no
check. `validate_menu_keys!` compares menu against menu and `validate_chords!` chord against
chord; nothing compared the two. `spec/tui/menu_letter_meaning_spec.cr` now does, and it looks
past the keymap's single scope because the operator's keystroke does:

- **every OS profile × editor keyset.** `vim` respells a bundle (⇧V select-line, editor `/`
  `a` `g` `⇧G`), so a letter clean under `helix` can clash for the operators who picked `vim`.
- **the Editor scope**, which `Runner#resolve_verb_id` consults ahead of the tab while a text
  editor pane has focus — helix `i` is "insert" in the Repeater request pane.
- **the sub-tab strip's raw keys** (`r` rename, `t` mark, `h/j/k/l` move), which the keymap
  cannot see and which share the card with COMMON when the strip has focus.
- **the Global fallback**, for a letter the tab leaves unbound: a menu `c` whose space was
  dropped stops capture, and an `i` holds all traffic. The scope lens is the one Global
  whose fall-through is harmless (a reversible view filter), and the only one excused.

Exceptions are listed as exact `{menu verb, other meaning}` pairs with a reason, never as a
`(scope, letter)`, so a later row on the same letter is still caught; an entry that stops
violating fails the spec until its line is deleted. The list started as the 67 pairs standing
when the guard landed, and the #1274 work packages shrink it. The guard covers the SHIPPED
defaults — a user rebind that recreates a clash is the Hotkeys editor's `Conflicts` check.

### 2026-09-25: the menu's movement keys never run a destructive or outbound row

Refines: the entry above. #1274 WP1, first stage.

Inside the space menu `j`/`k`/`h`/`l` move the selection only when the open card does not use
that letter, so one reflexive keystroke moved in one card and ran an action in the next — and
in the JWT and Cookie cards `k` cleared the session, in the Decoder's `l` its input, with no
prompt and no undo. The first stage keeps that fallback and moves every row that destroys,
overwrites or reaches out off the four letters:

- **Every workbench clear is `K` and asks first** (JWT, Cookie, Decoder, Notes), skipping the
  prompt only when the session is already empty — `notes_clear`'s rule, now shared. JWT and
  Cookie **load decoded** overwrite the encode editors and are `L`.
- **OAST listen is `r`**, as `r` runs every other tab's job, and resume is `R`, its chord.
- **Probe's bulk dismissals are `G`/`H`**, the capital forms of the one-issue `c`.
- **Destructive bands close the card.** `SpaceMenu#split_semantic` used to append a
  half-tagged bucket's untagged rows after DANGER and WIPE, so Notes led with Clear. The
  untagged band now sits ahead of them, which is what GROUP_ORDER always promised.

Whether the fallback stays and `h`/`j`/`k`/`l` stop being menu letters altogether (Link is `k`
on six tabs) is settled after the grouped menu lands, when most cards fit one column.

### 2026-09-25: a pane-local key is declared on the verb, not hidden in its gate

Refines: the R1 guard entry above. #1274 WP2 #3, #4, #13.

The Repeater's bare `p` (pretty bodies) and `⇧D` (diff) and the Fuzzer's `v` (distribution
sidebar) were bound tab-wide, so they fired in the request and template panes, whose menus
spell the same letters for pretty-print-request, the decoder chain and clear-selection. An
`available:` lambda could have hidden the key there, but the guard cannot read a lambda, and
the palette would have lost the row as well.

- **`Definition#chord_sections`** names the sections (the controller's `command_section`) in
  which the verb's chords fire; nil means the whole scope. It gates the KEY only: the palette
  and the space menu still follow `available?` and `section`.
- **Out of its sections the press walks on**, like an unavailable verb (`Keymap#resolve`, the
  scope chain `Runner#resolve_verb_id` now calls). So a gate on a letter Global binds would reach
  capture, intercept or the lens. The R1 guard models that walk, and a gated key is no clash
  for a menu row drawn only in other sections.
- `ExecContext#focused_section` is the value it is checked against, and the same one the
  space menu renders for.

A later R1 exception whose two meanings live in different panes of one tab can take this
instead of an allowlist line.

### 2026-09-25: a menu letter in UI text is read from the registry

Refines: the two entries above. #1274 WP3/WP8.

Help's verb-id rows resolved a chord through the keymap, but a menu-only verb has no chord, so
the row printed its hand-typed `space → X` unchecked — and three had drifted (Tag subtab `a`
for `t`, gRPC reframe `F` for `R`, and a row naming `oast.promote`, which never existed). The
same literal sat in toasts and hint strips, and in the Sitemap filter's `tag:` help (`T` for
`m`).

- **`Hotkeys.menu_path` is the one place a menu path is spelled.** A Help row whose verb has
  no chord prints it; hint text writes `{space:verb.id}`, which `Hotkeys.expand` resolves next
  to `{verb.id}`. When the menu grows a second level, that function is what changes.
- **No registry never prints the token.** It reads "the space menu" instead — the
  `{fuzz.sort}` footer bug in a new shape is what this rules out.
- **`spec/verb/hint_token_expands_spec.cr` scans `src/gori`** for a literal `space → <key>`
  outside comments, and every `{space:…}` token must name a verb with a menu row. A row named
  by its TITLE ("space → Mine parameters") names no letter and is left alone.

### 2026-09-25: a recurring intent spells its menu letter once, in a lexicon

Refines: the 2026-09-12 bare-key table. #1274.

That table settled bare letters by question, but the space menu's letters were still chosen row
by row, and they drifted the same way: seven list filters said `f` in the menu while their key
was `/`. A verb now declares `intent:` and `Verb::Lexicon` supplies the letter, so the grammar
holds by construction rather than by review — a verb with an intent cannot also spell a
`mnemonic:`. 288 of the 466 menu rows declare one; 277 of them were already on the letter.

- **Two tiers.** A *reserved* letter (`/` `d` `x` `y` `Y` `S` `t` `T` `N` `X`, and the strip's
  own actions) is spent on nothing else anywhere in a scope that has the intent. A *preferred*
  letter is the intent's where it exists and free for a local row elsewhere; reserving all
  thirty-odd app-wide would leave a dozen letters for the rows that are genuinely one tab's.
- **Boot refuses what has no exceptions** (`Registry#validate_intents!`): an unknown intent, an
  intent beside a mnemonic, a menu `X` on anything but a `:wipe` verb in group `:wipe`, and a
  pane verb wearing one of the strip's nine (`n w d e t f / T N`) on a tab that has a strip —
  even a strip that lacks that action, since the nine read the same on all nine strips.
- **The spec holds what needs judgement** (`spec/verb/lexicon_spec.cr`): the reserved sweep, and
  a menu verb whose id names an intent (`…filter`, `…copy`, `…delete`) must declare it, so a new
  row cannot opt out silently. Both keep exact-row allowlists that fail once an entry is stale.
- **An intent on one tab is not an entry**, and some recurring rows stay untagged until another
  decision lands: Link `k` and add-host `h` (the `h`/`j`/`k`/`l` decision), go to source and
  Probe's open, History/Detail delete `D`, file-as-issue on Probe `p` and Evidence/Diff `i`
  (Diff's `a` is pick A), Miner's filter `F` (its strip owns `/`), Notes' find `s`.

### 2026-09-25: the palette's typed search finds the focused tab's actions

Revises: "the palette and the space menu are disjoint" (`Registry#for_scope`'s comment). #1282,
first stage.

The space menu is the only surface that lists a tab's actions, and it has no query line, so every
action anyone might ever need had to be a row on it. The palette already is the typed-search
surface, so its search now covers them too:

- **Browse stays app control.** With an empty query the palette is today's curated Global list,
  exactly.
- **Typed search is scope-aware.** `Ctrl-P` captures the same `ActionContext` (scope, section,
  sub-tabs bucket, marks banner) `Space` does, and both list from `Registry#for_view`, so they
  cannot disagree about "what can I do here". The palette keeps the actions with no menu letter.
  They rank first under THIS TAB, ahead of Global's matches. Each group is ranked on its own, so
  rows do not jump between groups while you type.
- **Captured, then re-checked.** Availability is read before the palette takes `@overlay`, since
  some gates read it (an open History detail). A tab pick is re-checked after the palette closes.
  Closing the palette puts back a History detail it was opened over, so the pick runs where its
  chord would (P1).
- **The space menu still has no query line.** Search already has a home.

Editor-scope verbs are not searched: the space menu does not list them either. Which rows move
off the space menu into palette-only placement is stage 2, after the grouped menu lands.


### 2026-09-25: the space menu gets a second level, for verb families

Refines: [P1](#p1) and the R1 guard entry above. #1274 WP9.

A tab's cross-tool sends were eight rows and eight letters each, and the letters drifted per tab
(Send to Fuzzer was `z` on History and `F` on the Repeater). A `Verb::Family` now draws them as
one row, **`>` Send flow to…**, whose card lists the members. Every member is still a
`Definition` and runs through `Definition#call`; only the menu's presentation is new.

- **Membership reuses `intent`.** A family's letter table (intent → level-2 letter, in row order)
  is the only place a member's letter is spelled, so one intent reads one letter in every scope
  by construction. Lexicon intents and family intents are disjoint, and boot refuses a member
  that also spells a `mnemonic:`.
- **`pinned:` keeps a member at level 1 too**, on its own letter: Send to Repeater stays `r`
  (`R` on the Fuzzer and Miner) and is also `> r` everywhere. Only a pinned member keeps a
  `mnemonic:`; `menu_key` is the level-1 key alone, and nil for an unpinned member.
- **A family row is static.** It is drawn whenever the view registers a member, never decided by
  `available?` and never collapsed into a lone member. With nothing available the card says so
  instead of dismissing, so `space > r` typed blind cannot fall through to the pane's bare `r`.
  The row sits in its family's band, in the first bucket that holds a member.
- **R1 governs level 1 only.** A family key is checked like any menu letter (the guard sweeps
  `family:<id>` rows); level-2 letters are reached after two keys, never by a dropped space, so
  they are exempt. They are never `h`/`j`/`k`/`l`, which a sticky card needs for navigation and
  which keeps the pending `hjkl` decision open.
- **Validation is per view at both levels**: level 1 is every row's key (family keys included),
  level 2 is one member per intent per view — per view and not per scope, since the Repeater's
  request and response panes never render together.
- **`esc` and `⌫` go back one level**; `esc` at level 1 closes, and an unmapped key closes the
  whole menu. A sticky family re-opens its card after a member runs unless that member opened
  something of its own, and `ExecContext#menu_state` draws a row's `●`/`○` or value. Both wait
  for the toggle families.
- **One tool-letter table** (`Verb::TOOL_LETTERS`) serves this card and the Send selection to…
  picker, so Sequencer is `s` in both. Decoder keeps the `d` that picker taught first, so Discover
  is `D`. With Discover gone from level 1, History's and the detail's Delete take the lexicon
  `d` (the entry above listed them as waiting on this).

### 2026-09-25: the toggles are two sticky families that show their state

Refines: the entry above. #1274 WP9.

The view and transport toggles cost a level-1 letter each, and one toggle read three letters:
hex was `e` in the History detail, `x` in the Repeater request pane and `h` in its response pane,
because select-line owns `x` in two of the three. Two families now hold them.

- **`Z` Display…** holds what changes how a pane *draws* what it holds: hex, pretty, Unicode
  escapes, whitespace, diff, envelope/decoded, static assets, follow, columns, the Sitemap's
  folds and JS references, the Fuzzer's matched-only and distribution lenses, and the
  Comparer's pane and fold. A write-back (pretty-print request, pretty-print template) changes
  the request and stays a direct row, and so does the Fuzzer's sort, the key a results triage
  presses most. The key is not `V`: under the `vim` keyset `⇧V` selects a line in every pane
  the row is drawn in, which the R1 guard reports.
- **`P` Protocol…** holds what changes what a Repeater or Fuzzer request *sends*: HTTP/2,
  SNI, auto Content-Length, the WebSocket key, gRPC reframe and field editor, and the TLS
  fingerprint. Fuzzer Save results takes the export `E` to free `P`.
- **Sticky, with a state column.** After a member runs the card comes back at the same row,
  and `ExecContext#menu_state` draws `●`/`○` or a value (the TLS preset's name). The tab in
  front answers through `TabController#menu_state`; the shell answers for its own flags
  (pretty, whitespace, the static lens). The card stays closed when the member opened
  something — an overlay, a picker, a prompt, or a pane that took the keys
  (`TabController#pane_captures_keys?`: INSERT, the SNI field, the request hex editor, the
  gRPC field list) — or moved focus; `SpaceMenu.resume_sticky?` is that decision.
- **A member is a toggle.** `^T` drops a `§` marker on a tab with no envelope/decoded split, a
  write, so Display…'s envelope row is its own verb (`repeater.toggle-envelope`), listed only
  where there is a split. The History detail's Copy flow copied the raw request, which Copy as…
  already offers, and is gone.

### 2026-09-25: a menu letter is never h, j, k or l

Closes: the WP1 first-stage entry above ("settled after the grouped menu lands"). #1274.

Inside the space menu `j`/`k`/`h`/`l` move the selection only when the open card does not use
that letter. With Link on `k` in six tabs and add-host on `h`, the same reflex moved in one card
and acted in the next, and a sticky family card, which stays up after a row ran, made the next
reflex keystroke likelier still. The fallback stays; the letters go.

- **No row wears one, at either level.** `Registry#validate_intents!` refuses a level-1 letter
  (a pinned member included, and a letter derived from a chord as much as a mnemonic) in
  `Family::NAV_LETTERS`, and `Family#validate!` refuses one as a family's key or a level-2
  letter. Global and Editor draw no card and are exempt (`Registry::NO_SPACE_MENU`).
- **The movers take lexicon letters.** Link… and Manage links are `:link` → `L`, add-host is
  `:scope_add` → `H`. Discover's run stepping is `J`/`K` (`[`/`]` are Global tab switching, which
  a dropped space would reach), the Fuzzer's list paste `A`, and Activity's level filter `v` in
  the menu while its bare `l` stays.
- The Project Picker's hand-rolled menu already had no row on the four; it keeps the same
  fallback.

### 2026-09-25: the space menu is for the frequent, the palette for the long tail

Closes: the #1282 first-stage entry above ("which rows move off the space menu … is stage 2").
#1282.

Once the palette's typed search found a tab's actions, a rare action no longer needed a
space-menu row to be reachable, and the busiest cards were still two or three columns (the
Repeater request pane drew 30 rows, the Fuzzer template 28). A verb now declares where it is
listed: `menu: :palette` (`Verb::Placement`) gives it no space-menu row at either level, and
the palette's search finds it from its own tab. The default stays `:space`.

- **The criterion.** A row goes to the palette when it only repeats a direct chord for an
  editing or navigation convenience (Mark word `^K`, Decoder Save/Load `^S`/`^O`, a rule
  list's reorder `⇧K`/`⇧J`), or when it is a once-a-session configuration action (Minimize
  request, Use as refresh for slot…, Change prefix). The first set is 37 verbs; the busiest
  views drop to 25 and 22 rows.
- **Nothing else changes about the verb.** Its chords fire as before, it runs through
  `Definition#call`, and its `available?` gate is the palette's too. It keeps its `intent`:
  the placement is where it is listed, the intent is what it means, and the letter comes back
  from the lexicon if the verb ever returns to the menu.
- **No row means no letter rules.** `menu_key` is nil, so the boot validators and the R1
  guard have nothing to check. `Registry#validate_intents!` refuses a palette-only verb that
  spells a `mnemonic:` (a letter no card draws), belongs to a family or is pinned (its family
  would draw it), or is hidden (the palette would not list it either).
- **Every surface names the route that exists.** `Hotkeys.route` is the menu path for a menu
  row, and for a palette-only verb its effective chord, else `^P → <title>` spelled from the
  palette's own effective chord. Help's key column and every `{space:…}` token go through it,
  so a hint never sends the operator to a row the verb does not have.
- **Not a row budget.** Which rows move is decided per verb against the criterion, never by
  counting a view's rows, so adding an unrelated verb cannot push another one off the menu.

### 2026-09-25: the SUB-TABS bucket is one row in a pane, and expanded on the strip

Revises: #1055 ("the bucket rides along with every pane view"). #1274 Decision 8.

#1055 made the strip's actions reachable from every level of a tab, which was right, but by
drawing all of them in every pane card: nine or ten rows of the Repeater request pane's 25 were
the strip's, and the nine letters were reserved in every pane, which is what pushed Mark word,
the JWT/Cookie lens toggles and others off their natural letters.

- **Discoverable as one row.** A pane view draws the bucket as **`T` Sub-tabs…**
  (`Registry::SUBTABS_FOLD`), whose card is the whole bucket on the letters it already had. It
  is not a registered family: membership is the section, and each row's level-2 letter is its
  own `menu_key`, the nine that were already uniform on all nine strips. The row is static,
  like a family row.
- **Expanded where the strip is focused.** With the strip or the tab bar focused the strip is
  the context, so the bucket stays at level 1 and there is no Sub-tabs… row. `n` from the strip
  is `T n` from a pane; `Hotkeys.menu_path` prints the pane path unless told the strip has focus
  (the palette's hint column knows).
- **`T` keeps its reflex.** It was Mark all sub-tabs; from a pane it is now `T T`.
- **Frequent rows stay direct.** `pinned:` now also keeps a SUB-TABS verb at level 1 in the pane
  views (Paste cURL, `U`); New and Close keep `^N`/`^W`.
- **Letters.** The strip's nine stay reserved for COMMON, which shares the strip-focused card;
  a pane verb is free of them except `T`, which `validate_menu_keys!` checks per view. The freed
  letters are not reassigned here.
- **Mark sub-tab joins the menu** on `t`, the strip's own raw `t` (the active chip only, without
  the strip's step right, which from a pane would switch the sub-tab being edited). Tag moved to
  `g`, which ends the one standing R1 pair between a menu letter and the strip's raw keys other
  than rename's `r`.

### 2026-09-26: a family's key works bare, and a chip reads its path from the registry

Refines: the verb-family entries and "a menu letter in UI text is read from the registry"
above. #1295.

- **A family may bind its own key bare** (`Verb::Family#chord`). Send flow to… does: `>` opens
  its card from any tab that has a member, through the menu's own open and descend
  (`Runner#open_space_family`), so the bare key and `space >` are one path. It is bound once per
  scope by a hidden verb (`Registry#register_family_openers`), never Global, and the R1 guard
  reads that verb as the family row's own meaning. Display… and Protocol… keep `space`: `Z` and
  `P` are letters a pane may still want.
- **A chip is a menu path too.** A border badge or a tight hint spells it with
  `Hotkeys.menu_chip` (`␣Pr`), and the guard that refuses a literal `space → X` refuses a
  literal `␣X`. A view takes the session's registry from its controller; without one the chip
  is a bare `␣`.
- **One chord may advertise two verbs** when one of them answers both panes: the Repeater's
  `^X` toggles the focused pane's hex, so the response row declares `chord_of:` and shows it. A
  scope still binds a chord to one verb; boot checks the chord is live in the row's section.
- **A family row joins a band only beside another row of it.** Where nothing else of its
  bucket is in the family's band, the row stays with the untagged rows, so no card draws a
  header over the family row alone (ProbeDetail's `─ SEND ─`).
- **Show all is one Display… intent** (`:show_all`, `a`): Probe's closed issues and the Params
  tab's standard headers are the same lens, on the letter both tabs already answer bare.

### 2026-09-26: no level-1 `c` or `i` where the tab leaves the letter to Global

Closes: #1274 Decision 10 (the eight Global fall-through pairs in the R1 guard). #1295.

Global binds three bare letters, `c` (stop capture), `i` (hold all traffic) and `s` (the scope
lens). On a tab that does not bind the letter itself, a menu row on it is one dropped `space`
away from the Global action, and for `c` and `i` that action is silent and changes what the
proxy does. The scope lens stays excused: it is a view filter the next `s` undoes.

- **The rows move.** `:set_status`, `:duplicate_rule` and the new `:clear_marks` (the Repeater
  and Fuzzer marker clears, one intent now) are `C` in the lexicon, so each moves on every tab
  at once. JWT's Copy attack token is `C`, like Copy re-signed token in the pane beside it.
  Diff's Add issue is `F`, its own `⇧F`, since `a` is Diff's pick-A.
- **The guard is the rule.** The R1 guard already reports a Global fall-through; with the
  eight allowlist lines gone, a new `c`/`i` row on such a tab fails it, and the only way back is
  an allowlist line with a reason. A tab that binds the letter itself (Probe's `c` dismiss) is
  unaffected, because the press never reaches Global.

### 2026-09-26: the other R1 pairs, closed by a rule or a move

Refines: the R1 guard entry above. #1295.

- **vim motions are a rule, not eight allowlist lines.** Under the `vim` keyset an editor pane
  answers `a` `g` `⇧G` `/` and `⇧V` with append, top, bottom, find and select line, and eight
  menu rows share those letters. A dropped space there runs the motion a vim hand expects,
  which moves or selects and never writes, sends or deletes, so the guard exempts those verbs
  by id (`VIM_MOTIONS`) under that keyset only. Undo (`u`) and helix's `i` insert are not in
  it, and an example fails if an exempt verb moves into an acting band (send, triage, danger,
  wipe) or out of the vim table.
- **The strip's rename key is `e`.** The menu's Rename is `e` on all nine strips and its `r`
  is Send/Run on four of them, so the strip moves to the menu's letter rather than the menu to
  the strip's, and strip `r` does nothing (`^R` still sends from the Repeater strip). The
  project picker already renamed on `e`.
- **The Fuzzer's Save results is `⇧E`,** the Export chord of four tabs. Its `⇧S` was also
  what a typed menu `S` (Send selection to…, on every Fuzzer view) sends to the keymap.

### 2026-09-26: later reversals in the #1274 entries, and the rules their review added

Refines: the 2026-09-25 #1274/#1282 entries and "no level-1 `c` or `i` where the tab leaves the
letter to Global" above. #1274, #1295.

The log is append-only, so the statements that later entries overturned are named here instead
of being edited in place.

- **Pane rows and the strip's nine.** The lexicon entry has boot refuse a pane verb on any of
  the strip's nine letters. Since the SUB-TABS fold only COMMON reserves them, and a pane view
  reserves only `T` (`validate_menu_keys!`).
- **The Miner's filter `F`.** The lexicon entry's reason, "its strip owns `/`", went with the
  fold. The row keeps `F`; the reason no longer holds.
- **Pane-local keys.** The pane-local key entry's reason, that the request and template menus
  spell `p`, `⇧D` and `v` for other rows, now holds only for the Fuzzer template's `v` (Clear
  selection). The gate stays: in those panes the lenses draw nothing.
- **Write-backs.** The toggles entry keeps pretty-print request and pretty-print template as
  direct rows. Both are palette-only on `^U` now, and so is the decoder chain (`^Q`).
- **Save results.** The toggles entry gives it the export `E`. It is palette-only, on `⇧E`.
- **Discover's `J`/`K` and the Fuzzer's list paste `A`.** The h/j/k/l entry gives them menu
  letters. All three are palette-only (list paste keeps `^L`).
- **The tab bar is app-level focus.** With the tab bar focused, `Space` still lists the tab's
  rows, but a bare key resolves Sidebar → Global. A tab's own loop letter that Global also binds
  (`c` or `i`, such as Probe's `c` Dismiss) therefore stops capture or holds traffic there, not
  the row's action. That is accepted: on the tab bar the Global keys win by design, and the tab
  keeps its letter everywhere else. The R1 guard models the tab bar and allowlists these pairs
  by name, so "the press never reaches Global" above holds everywhere but the tab bar.
- **A pane that owns its keys has its own scope.** Help and the Project tab's NETWORK settings
  pane are `Scope::Help` and `Scope::ProjectSettings`, verb-less, not History's `Body`: a
  borrowed scope drew that tab's static family rows and answered its bare family keys.
- **The keymap's layering reaches the family openers and the hints.** A chord a configured layer
  (user, keyset or OS row) puts on a Global verb keeps a family's bare opener off it on every
  tab (`Keymap.global_claims`); `space >` still opens the card. `Hotkeys.binding_for` never
  advertises a chord the keymap fires as another verb in that scope (`Keymap.displaced?`), so a
  footer, Help or the palette does not name a default an override took.
- **`chord_of` names an owner, never a chain.** The target has a chord of its own and no
  `chord_of`, in the same scope with that chord live in the row's section; boot refuses anything
  else (`Registry#check_chord_of!`). The Hotkeys editor shows the borrowed key as "(via
  <owner>)" and sends an edit to the owner's row.
- **The hint scan reads every spelling of a path.** Besides `space → X` and `␣X`, it refuses an
  arrowless `space X` / `Space X` and a spaced `␣ X` chip in a non-comment source line.

### 2026-09-26: timing analysis lives in the Repeater, is synchronous, and compares a pair (#1246)

The differential timing oracle from PortSwigger's "Listen to the whispers" — send two variants
many times and judge which is slower by response ORDER and quartiles, not eyeballed latency — is
the measurement layer on top of the #1236 synchronized-release race. Three decisions, so a later
reader does not re-litigate them:

- **Repeater, not the Comparer** (the issue's title said `feat(comparer)`). The Comparer is a
  static two-sample diff: `ComparerSlot` holds a snapshot's bytes, the diff rows are memoized, and
  there is no repetition, engine hookup or async-result channel anywhere in it. The selection this
  feature wants is two LIVE drafts sharing one origin and transport — which is exactly what the
  marked sub-tab gesture (`t`) and `collect_race_members` already produce for `repeater.send-race`.
  So the verb is `repeater.timing-analysis`, a sibling of send-race, and reuses its collector,
  origin/transport signature check, and off-fiber launch. Folding a run loop into the Comparer
  would have fought its whole design.
- **Synchronous, not a background job.** gori's other repeated-sampling tools (Fuzzer, Sequencer,
  Miner, Discover) are start/status/results/stop jobs because they can run unbounded. Timing is a
  bounded pair-vs-pair measurement (`Stats::MAX_ITERATIONS`), so it is one call that returns a
  `Report`, the shape `race_requests` has — one MCP tool, one CLI subcommand, and the TUI wraps the
  same call in a fiber for progress + an esc-cancel, rather than four job verbs per surface.
- **A pair only in v1.** The engine (`Repeater::Timing`) races whatever it is handed, but the order
  test and the verdict are defined over two variants; `>2` is left to a later change, as the issue
  scoped it.

The math is a pure `Repeater::Timing::Stats` (percentile quartiles + a two-sided binomial sign test
on the order bias, `Math.erfc` for the tail, a `SMALL_SAMPLE` floor that clamps to Inconclusive) and
a shared `Timing::Present` renderer, the `Sequencer::Stats`/`Present` split — so the CLI `--format
json` and the MCP tool cannot drift, and the TUI card reuses `Spark` for the distribution.

### 2026-09-26: Display… and Protocol… open bare too, and R1 sweeps level 2 behind a dead key

Revises: "a family's key works bare" above ("Display… and Protocol… keep `space`") and the
verb-family entry's "R1 governs level 1 only". #1310.

A level-2 letter is not always reached after two keys. With no bare binding for `Z`, a dropped
`space` made `Z` a no-op and read the member letter bare: `Z c` (Columns…) stopped capture on
History, `P c` (auto Content-Length) did the same in the Repeater, `P 2` (HTTP/2) jumped to the
second tab, and `Z x` selected a line under the helix keyset. Before the families, those rows were
capitals, which never reach Global.

- **Both toggle families bind their key bare**, `⇧Z` and `⇧P`, as Send flow to… binds `>`:
  a hidden opener per scope that has a member, never Global. No scope, keyset or Global bound
  either key where a member is drawn; `⇧P` stays previous-item in the detail views and the
  Comparer, which have no Protocol… member. The member letters do not move, so one intent still
  reads one letter on every tab.
- **The R1 guard sweeps level 2 wherever the family key answers nothing** (`bare_answer`: the
  Editor link, the tab's scope where the chord is live in every view of the row, then Global),
  checking each member letter as it checks a level-1 row. A family with a working bare key is
  not swept, because its letters are only ever read inside the card.
- **The strip answers its raw keys, then Global.** A focused strip keeps its own navigation,
  mark and picker keys (`> f` opens the sub-tab picker and the Comparer's `Z t` marks the chip),
  then resolves an unhandled chord in `Scope::Global` only. It never dispatches into the active
  tab or Editor scope, so `?` works there without typing through into the pane.

### 2026-09-27: MCP permission groups are a third reason a tool is absent

Preferences › AI › MCP permissions switches off groups of `gori mcp` tools from gori itself, where
`--read-only` and `--tools` are decided in the agent's install. Four groups — `send`, `intercept`,
`write`, `projects` (`Settings::MCP_PERMISSIONS`) — all on by default. Reading is never a group.

- **Declared per tool, next to its handler**: `@[Tool(permission:)]`, required on every
  `agent_action` tool by the registry macro, and on every other writer by
  `spec/mcp/tool_permissions_spec.cr`, which names the operator channel as the one exemption.
  A group never splits a `requires:` workflow.
- **The same two answers as `--read-only`**: absent from `tools/list` and refused with
  `TOOL_DISABLED`, and the three predicates compose (`Tools.serves?`). `advertises?` reads the
  switches, because a restart without `--read-only` does not bring a switched-off tool back.
- **The arguments decide where one mode sends**: `Tools#call_denied_permission` is the one place
  for that — `probe_scan{active}` and `set_probe_mode` raised to an active mode are `send`. A new
  call-shaped sender goes there, not into its handler.
- **Latched at start and never fail-open.** Read once per `gori mcp` process, like `channels`. A
  settings file the start could not read in full is re-read for this section alone, and denies
  every group when even that fails.
- **Its own settings section** (`mcp_permissions`), because the save merge reconciles whole
  sections: sharing `mcp` with `channels` let one window's stale copy of the denials win.
- **Groups are capabilities, not destinations.** Intercept control still lets an agent forward
  an edited held request, and those bytes reach the target with Send traffic off. Turning off
  both is what stops an agent's bytes reaching a target; the docs say so.

### 2026-09-27: what the operator is owed from the agent channel while nobody is watching

#1090 made the channel a notification, not a mailbox: a TUI seeds its tails at the feed's end
when it opens. Three follow-ups keep that rule and carve out what the operator is owed.
#1322, #1323, #1324.

- **Replies get a watermark, not a replay.** `agent_reply_seen` in the project's `settings`
  table (two projects are two feeds) records the last reply a window showed. It moves forward
  only. A window writes it when its live drain announces a reply, when the ring opens and when
  it closes. The next window to open pushes ONE addressed note for `(watermark, cursor]`, whose
  detail lists the newest fifty. Delivery rows and every other feed row keep the seed-at-now rule.
- **"Addressed to the operator" is the kind; who is speaking is the source.** `gori run notify`
  writes the `agent_reply` shape under a new `script` source (`actor: cli`), so one drain and one
  watermark serve both, and the ring's `ai` marker, which reads the source, stays off a shell loop.
- **A question is closed by exactly one message.** An `ask_operator` question is an
  `agent_question` row with no state column. It stays open until an `agent_message` with
  `in_reply_to` exists, and that message is also how the answer travels, so every delivery route
  carries it without a route of its own. `Store#insert_event_unless` checks and inserts in one
  `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction, so the operator's answer and the expiry cannot both land.
- **The asker expires its own question.** The `gori mcp` courier closes an unanswered question
  when its time is up. It is the one process that must hear about it, and with no TUI open
  nothing else would write it. The TUI also stops offering it on the clock and when the asker's
  marker is gone, because an answer addressed to a dead pid is read by nobody.
- **A question never takes focus.** It is a ring note Miss Ring holds, plus an `ask:N` chip. The
  card opens only from the ring's `↵`, the chip or `app.answer-agent`, because a card that
  appeared mid-edit would turn the next keystroke into an answer. `esc` means "later", and `x` is
  the explicit dismissal the agent hears. An answer is a request, like any operator message: the
  frame says it authorizes nothing, and scope still decides what is sent.

### 2026-09-27: `flows.id` and `h2_connections.id` are AUTOINCREMENT, switched in place (#1343)

Both were `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY` without AUTOINCREMENT, so a clear or a delete of the newest
flows handed the next capture an id that had named another flow, and every holder of one (a
mark, a link, frozen evidence, an MCP cursor or job result, a peer process that never saw the
delete) pointed at the wrong traffic. #1342 patched the consumers that were visibly wrong. V39
removes the cause: an id, once issued, is never issued again. The consumer guards stay as
defence in depth.

- **In place, not rebuilt.** AUTOINCREMENT does not change a table's on-disk format, only how
  the next rowid is picked, so `Schema.autoincrement_in_place` edits the stored CREATE text and
  bumps `schema_version`, the change SQLite documents for format-preserving edits. 2–7 ms at
  1 GB and at 3.4 GB. The V10-style rebuild that #552 measured and refused on open (16 s at
  50k flows) is 5–7 s per GB under the write lock with its verification, and it leaves the file
  twice its size until a compact, because the old table's pages go to the freelist.
- **The rebuild stays as the definition and the fallback.** V39's statements are the rebuild, so
  a bare connection replays one definition, and `migrate!` runs them whenever the edit is
  refused, the CREATE text is not the one V1 wrote, or the edited text does not reparse to the
  same columns (the savepoint puts the old text back first). The edit lifts
  SQLITE_DBCONFIG_DEFENSIVE for its statements, because macOS's system libsqlite3 has it on and
  refuses `writable_schema`.
- **The fallback proves its copy before any DROP.** `verify_v39_copy` compares every non-BLOB
  column of every row, by value and storage class (`IS` alone compares under column affinity,
  so a TEXT `'443'` equals the INTEGER a copy converted it to), plus BLOB lengths, sampled BLOB
  bytes, the FTS rowids at both ends and every `h2_connections` row. A mismatch rolls the whole
  upgrade back. A disk that fills during the copy is reported with the free space it needs
  (about twice the project file), not as a bare SQLITE_FULL.
- **Seeded past every reference, not `MAX(id)`.** `sqlite_sequence` starts above every column
  that can hold a flow id, the FTS rowids and the negated evidence sources, so an emptied table
  cannot hand a stranded reference its id back. V10's rule, applied to `flows`.
- **A read-only open may migrate it.** `Store.open(read_only: true)` already upgrades a stale
  schema; at milliseconds that stays acceptable. The cross-project search reads raw and never
  migrates, and the column set it reads did not change.
- **Not done here.** `entity_links` still deletes a flow's links rather than keeping them as
  `(stale)`, and the History marks, colour memos and MCP `since` check still guard against a
  reused id. Each can be relaxed on its own now that ids are monotonic.

### 2026-09-27: eight more tables get AUTOINCREMENT, the way `flows` did (#1344)

Extends V10 (fuzz and miner sessions) and the `flows` entry above to every other table whose id
leaves the process: `repeaters`, `probe_custom_rules`, `probe_issues`, `issues`, `match_rules`,
`scope_rules`, `host_overrides` and `fuzz_runs`. Each was `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY` without
AUTOINCREMENT, so deleting the newest row or wiping the table gave the next insert an id that had
named another row. The holder is usually another process (`gori mcp`, `gori run`, a peer TUI),
which never saw the delete. The audit reproduced three cases. A promoted Probe finding linked its
issue to an unrelated Repeater tab. A recreated custom rule inherited `custom_p_<id>` and with it
the deleted rule's suppressions and dismissed rows. `add_retest_step` with a wiped issue's id
passed the gone-issue guard. V40 does all eight in one migration.

- **In place per table, rebuilt where it must be.** `migrate_v40` hands every eligible table to
  V39's `autoincrement_in_place`, now given a table list, in one edit: the same savepoint, cookie
  read-back and column-shape check. The edit is a blind `replace()` of the rowid phrase, so
  eligibility (V39's too) is anchored to what gori writes: the first column is
  `id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY`, the phrase appears once in any case or spacing, and the text has no
  AUTOINCREMENT, CHECK, GENERATED or comment. A crafted archive with the real clause lowercased
  and the phrase inside a CHECK would otherwise have the edit land in the CHECK and fail every
  row. As a second guard, `PRAGMA quick_check` must pass on each edited table before the
  savepoint is released. An ADD COLUMN appends a plain declaration and leaves the rowid clause
  alone, so every table any gori wrote is eligible. A table that is not, or all eight when SQLite refuses the
  edit, takes the V10-shaped rebuild, which V40's statements spell and a bare replay runs.
  `Schema::TableRebuild` spells each table once and derives the copy, the swap and the seed.
  One table that must be rebuilt does not cost the others their edit. On a 466 MiB project with
  5,000 Repeater tabs (50 MB of responses), 10,000 findings and 100k flows: 16 ms in place,
  about 0.2 s rebuilt.
- **The rebuild proves its copy before any DROP.** `verify_rebuilt_copies` checks the column list
  on both sides, then totals (count, MIN/MAX id, `SUM(length())` per column), then every column of
  every row, BLOBs included, by value and storage class (V39's `v39_same`). These tables are
  small enough for that; the `flows` fallback samples its BLOB bytes. A mismatch rolls the whole
  upgrade back, and a disk that fills names the tables it was rebuilding.
- **Seeded past everything that still names a row.** That covers the columns and polymorphic refs
  (negated, detached ones by magnitude), the session slots' refresh steps and the disabled-rule
  set in `settings`, and the custom rule codes in findings, suppressions and OAST probes. It also
  covers the provenance a flow carries in `source_ref`: a Repeater tab id, `issue #N step M`,
  `project rule #N`. That text is read from `idx_flows_list`, which covers it, never from `flows`.
  Only an integer below 2^62 counts, judged per reference before its maximum is taken, so one
  odd value (an imported file named `issue #999…`, text in an id column) cannot hide the real
  ones beside it. No gori issues such an id, and a sequence at the top of int64 would fail every
  later insert with SQLITE_FULL.
- **The consumer guards stay.** Detached retest and refresh steps, `evidence_source_alive?` and
  the Repeater evidence count still guard, because a database upgraded from before V40 can hold
  references that were already re-bound. Closing a Repeater tab now also clears
  `probe_issues.sample_repeater_id`, since a pointer at a closed tab opens nothing. That runs on
  the writer fiber at every close, so V40 adds a partial index on the column, on either path,
  rather than scan every finding ([P6](#p6)).
- **Not migrated.** `extract_rules`, `oast_providers`, `color_rules`, `saved_views` and
  `entity_links` keep reusable ids. Where one leaves the process the surfaces address it another
  way. A saved view's pointer is cleared by the saved setting on every surface
  (`SavedViews.clear_active_if`). A link is removed by its (owner, ref) pair, which is UNIQUE, and
  never by its row id.

### 2026-09-28: the in-place AUTOINCREMENT edit reads no row, and `since` trusts the high-water mark

Two statements above are overturned here rather than edited in place. The #1344 entry's "as a
second guard, `PRAGMA quick_check` must pass on each edited table" no longer holds, and neither
does the #1343 entry's listing of the MCP `since` check among the guards against a reused id.

#1344 added `quick_check` on every edited table as a second guard behind eligibility. On `flows`
that walks the whole table, every body's overflow chain included: 10–16 s through `migrate!` on a
3.3 GB project, against 0.1–0.15 s without it, measured. That undid V39's reason for editing in
place: a peer waiting on the 5 s `busy_timeout` got `database is locked` on the first open after
an upgrade, and `gori mcp --read-only` held the write lock as long.

- **Eligibility is the guard, and it is read from the text.** What `quick_check` caught, an edit
  that landed somewhere other than the rowid clause, is what eligibility rules out before the
  edit: the phrase exactly once and as the first column, no CHECK, GENERATED, comment or
  AUTOINCREMENT, and now no WITHOUT ROWID tail either (SQLite refuses AUTOINCREMENT there). Under
  those conditions the blind `replace()` can only extend the rowid clause, so a read-back of the
  edited text would compare it with itself and was not added. The cookie read-back and the
  column-shape check stay. A spec cuts a body's overflow chain on disk and requires the edit to
  succeed regardless, so a check that reads rows cannot come back unnoticed.
- **MCP `since` is judged against the high-water mark.** `list_history` refused a cursor above
  `MAX(id)`, which before V39 meant the ids had restarted. Afterwards it meant "the newest flow was
  deleted" or "history was cleared", and the refusal sent a tailing agent back to since=0 to
  re-read everything, although the next capture lands above its cursor. The bound is now the
  highest id ever issued (`sqlite_sequence`, or `MAX(id)` where that row is missing).
  A cursor beyond it was not issued by the project as it stands and is still refused, without
  guessing why.

### 2026-09-28: scope and the sandbox are their own MCP permission group (#1348)

The 2026-09-27 groups put the five scope writers (`add_scope_rule`, `update_scope_rule`,
`delete_scope_rule`, `set_scope_enabled`, `set_sandbox`) under `write`, so an operator could not
let an agent record issues and notes without also letting it widen the scope or turn the sandbox
off. They now sit in a fifth group, `scope` ("Change scope & sandbox"), and `write` no longer
covers them. #1327 was untagged but already on main, so a `write: false` written by that build
must not read as "scope allowed" after the upgrade: an absent `scope` beside a denied `write`
is denied, and the serializer writes `scope: true` for the one combination that needs it.

- **It fences the fence, not the send.** `allow_unscoped:true` still lifts Layer 1 for a send
  with this group off; Layer 2 (the sandbox and explicit excludes) still applies to the bound
  project. Stopping an agent's out-of-scope sends is Send traffic's switch, the same
  "capabilities, not destinations" rule as Intercept control. Two writers outside the group also
  move where a request lands, and are deliberately left where they are: host overrides (`write`)
  remap an in-scope hostname's address, and `projects` can bind a project with no sandbox.
- **Reading stays ungrouped.** `list_scope` is served with the group off: an agent that is
  told SCOPE_BLOCKED still needs to see why. The hints that name `add_scope_rule` (`list_scope`,
  `ql_explain`'s `scope:` note, `list_history`'s `in_scope` note) name the operator instead
  when it is not served (`Tools#add_scope_rule_hint`), the way `no_binder_recovery` does for
  the binders. So does a SCOPE_BLOCKED remedy (`Tools#scope_remedy`): "add an include" becomes
  the operator's beside `allow_unscoped:true`, and "delete the EXCLUDE rule", which no waiver
  lifts, names only the operator.

### 2026-09-28: `sequencer_sessions` is AUTOINCREMENT too (#1354)

V10 left `sequencer_sessions` out because no link can name a session (`LinkRefKind` has no
`Sequencer` variant), and #1344 did not revisit it. A link is not the only holder. A peer TUI
keeps each tab's row id, and closing the newest session and opening another handed that id to the
new row. A peer whose tab was locked (unsaved edit, collection running) then took the new row for
its own tab in `reconcile`, and its next save overwrote the other operator's session. An Activity
row's `goto_session_id` opened the new session the same way. The test for leaving a table out is
"can anything outside this process hold its id", not "can a link name it".

- **V41 moves it the way V40 moved eight tables.** `migrate_v40` became
  `move_to_autoincrement(conn, rebuilds, version)`, shared by V40 and V41: in place where the
  CREATE text is gori's, the verified rebuild otherwise. The seed reads the events that point at a
  Sequencer session and any `sequencer` link, filtered like every other seed.

### 2026-09-29: a fuzz result's shape is a versioned fingerprint of its answer, and one aggregator clusters it (#1351)

The Distribution sidebar answers "how are the metrics spread", not "which responses are actually
different". Every result now carries `Fuzz::Result#shape`, and `Fuzz::Clusters` groups rows by it
for the TUI, `gori run fuzz show --clusters` and MCP `fuzz_results` / `get_fuzz_run`. The issue's
four open questions, answered:

- **What the key holds.** The outcome (a response, or a failed send folded to a coarse
  `Shape::ErrorClass`, since raw error text quotes hosts, ports and timings), status, gRPC
  status, the incomplete/timed-out flags, the WebSocket close code (folded in by
  `Result#with_ws`, the one seam that has it), the set of header names minus the ones that vary
  per response or with body size, the normalized `Location` and `Content-Type` values, and the
  decoded body with the job's own payload bytes masked (as generated, as spliced after a `¦chain`,
  HTML-escaped in each server's quote spelling (`&#39;`, `&#039;`, `&#x27;`, `&#34;`, `&apos;`),
  percent- and JSON-escaped, the last also Go-style `\u003c`), numbers and id-like tokens
  folded to one value marker (a random hex id is sometimes all digits), whitespace runs folded. NOT
  `length`, `words` or `lines`: a reflected payload moves all three, which is the split the
  masking exists to prevent; a cluster reports their range. No JSON-structure parse: the token
  normalization already folds values, and a structural walk would be a second decode (P6).
- **Stable across runs, within one `Shape::VERSION`.** FNV-1a over a versioned normalization, not
  Crystal's per-process seeded `#hash`, because the id is persisted (`fuzz_results.shape`, V42)
  and compared between a live job and its saved run. A normalization change bumps the version,
  which changes every id rather than silently merging old rows with new ones. Rows saved before
  V42 have no shape; they cluster by `Shape.approximate` (outcome + words/lines) in a separate key
  space and every surface marks those clusters approximate.
- **The representative is the lowest-index member.** Live results arrive out of order and a saved
  run is read in index order; the lowest index is the one rule both pick the same row under, and
  it makes offset paging deterministic (ties break on it too).
- **Opt-in arguments, not a `fuzz_clusters` tool.** `clusters: true` and `cluster: "<id>"` on the
  two tools that already page a run's rows keep one paging contract and one place an agent looks.
  The default row page is byte-identical.

Bounded throughout: the fingerprint reads the decoded body's first 16,384 NORMALIZED units (a
masked payload, a value, a word, a whitespace run or a punctuation byte each count one), capped at
256 KiB raw, plus one bit for whether the body went on (~46 µs on a large page, 0 B/op,
`bench/fuzz_shape_bench.cr`). Units, not bytes: a result page that echoes the query at its top
shifts every later byte by the payload's length, so a raw-byte window ended at a different place
for every payload and split the very cluster it existed to form. The price is that a difference
far below the window does not split a shape; the cluster's length range still shows it.
`Clusters` holds at most 4096 shapes and
counts later new ones as `overflow_rows`, and a saved run aggregates from the keyset-paged scalar
stream. There is deliberately no SQL `GROUP BY` twin: legacy rows cannot be grouped in SQL, and a
second implementation of one predicate is the drift the Scope SQL/in-memory pair already taught.
A live MCP job's aggregate sees every result while its row cache keeps only `interesting?` rows,
so a cluster of ordinary answers may list no member rows; the page says so (`members_retained`,
`members_note`) instead of implying the cluster is empty. The TUI's header drawn from a cluster's
metrics-only representative (its members all evicted from the display window) says the row left
the window, never "not retained", and seeds no Repeater/Comparer tab.

Known gaps, each a heuristic trade-off rather than an oversight:

- A needle is tried where a normalized unit starts, never inside a letter/digit token, and it
  has no word boundary. The two pull against each other: masking inside tokens would catch a
  marker spliced into an existing value (`user=adm§x§` echoed as `admx'`), and masking anywhere
  already lets a common-word payload (`div`, `header` from a content-discovery list) mask the
  page's own markup, so identical 404s split. Neither is fixed by a rule the fingerprint can
  apply to one response alone; the second is the one worth revisiting (e.g. not masking a
  plain-word needle inside markup).
- A failed send's class is read off its message text, so a host name in the message can pick
  it (`tls-gw.example.com`). A structured error kind on `Repeater::Result` is the real fix.
- A gRPC body is hashed as its wire bytes, so a payload that changes a message's length
also changes its 5-byte prefix and varint lengths, and a gRPC sweep can split one answer into a
few shapes by payload length. Deframing with `Grpc.scan_wire` first is the fix when it matters;
`grpc_status` is already its own key part, so a denied call never merges with a granted one.

### 2026-09-29: a wordlist is a file in a global catalog, and a bare name reads the working directory first (#1353)

`~/.gori/wordlists` was a convention only the TUI Fuzzer knew: its completion listed it, and inserted
an absolute path because the engine opened whatever it was handed relative to the working directory.
CLI, MCP, Miner and Discover took a path and nothing else, so a list saved once could not be picked
by name outside one text field. `Gori::WordlistCatalog` is the naming and placement layer over that
directory, and nothing more.

- **The contents stay files.** Not `settings.json` and not a project database: a file keeps the
  global-versus-project boundary (a project never inherits a list; a name is something the operator
  typed), reads lazily (`Fuzz::WordlistFile` walks a multi-GB list without materializing it) and is
  what an operator already drops in that directory by hand.
- **One resolution rule, in one place.** `WordlistCatalog.resolve` returns a value containing `/`
  unchanged, byte for byte, and looks a bare name up in the current directory first and the catalog
  second, so a file you have right here still beats a saved list of the same name. A bare name found
  nowhere comes back as typed and the consumer reports it in its own words, now saying where it
  looked. `Fuzz::WordlistFile`, `Fuzz::Presets` (the `NAME:FILE` merge), `Miner::Wordlist` and
  `Discover::Wordlist` call it, so the CLI, MCP and the TUI Fuzzer agree without a per-surface copy.
  The TUI cookie-crack field does not: it takes an inline secret list as well as a path, and a bare
  word there resolving to a file would replace a secret the operator typed.
- **The bytes are never normalized.** A blank line and a `#` line are payloads to the Fuzzer and
  formatting to the Miner and Discover (`merge_user_file`), and both are right for their tool. The
  catalog writes and copies verbatim and lists from `stat`; a line count reads at most 32 MiB and a
  value preview only happens on request, bounded. Values appear in no listing.
- **A name is a filename, never a path.** Letters and digits of any script, `_ . + -` and inner
  spaces, at most 200 bytes, never leading with `.` or `-`. No separator or control character can
  occur, and the staging file (`.NAME.gori….tmp`) is a hidden name the catalog never lists.
- **Writes are atomic, owner-only, and never an accident.** `DurableFile` stages the file at 0600 in
  the 0700 directory. Without `overwrite` the install is a hard link, which fails when the name is
  taken, so a save that races another lands as a refusal and not a replace; the `exists?` before it
  only stops a doomed save from staging gigabytes. A symlink a save would write through, or replace,
  is refused (delete it first), and `rename` moves a link as a link.
- **MCP treats it as a write.** `save_wordlist`, `rename_wordlist` and `delete_wordlist` sit in the
  `write` group (the catalog is a global record an operator lets an agent keep), work with no project
  bound, and `delete_wordlist` needs `confirm:true` like the other irreversible ones. `get_wordlist`
  returns values only with `include_values:true`.
- **The history remembers names, and the path when the name would lie.** `Settings.canonical_wordlist`
  is the key: a catalog list and the absolute path an older gori inserted are one entry.
  `Settings.remembered_wordlist` is what is stored, the name unless a file of that name in the working
  directory would shadow it (a bare name reads the directory first). There the path is kept, because
  the pick was inserted as a path for exactly that reason and the entry must not turn into the
  working-directory file the next time. The completion asks `resolve` when it inserts — its rule is
  not copied — so it still writes the shorter spelling whenever the name is enough. Two spellings
  that differ only by that shadow share a key, so starring or recording one replaces the other rather
  than listing a file the history cannot tell apart twice. The LIVE Run-row estimate stats the same
  `resolve_path` the engine opens.
- **Every writer goes through the catalog.** The Params `w` export used to write its own 0644 file
  and replace one of the same name. It now saves through `save_values`: 0600 like the rest, and a
  second press in the same second takes the next free `-2`, `-3` name rather than failing.

### 2026-09-29: a project payload source is read by the plan builder, and secrets stay out unless asked (#1352)

Fuzzer and Miner could only take values typed, listed in a file, or generated, while the project
already held the target's own vocabulary. `Gori::PayloadFrom` is a QL selector plus a projection
(`param-names`, `param-values`, `path-segments`, `js-endpoints`, `extracted`), and a surface only
parses its own syntax into a normalized `Spec`.

- **The plan builder reads the project.** `Fuzz::ProjectSource` and `Miner::PlanOptions#project_names`
  are built with nothing resolved, and `Plan.build` resolves them against `PlanOptions#project`,
  before the sets are paired with the pipeline. That is the same seam every tool has, so the CLI, MCP
  and the TUI cannot differ on caps, secrets or refusals, and the resolved size is what the preflight
  and the confirm already count. The read is never on the proxy path or the Store writer (P6): it is
  the parameter inventory's newest-first, id-cursor-paged walk, one flow in hand at a time.
- **Strict, bounded, reproducible.** The QL is refused for an unknown field, a dropped term (which
  would broaden the selection) or a regex that cannot compile. Flows, distinct values, total bytes
  and one value's length are capped, and what ended a read is on its report. `js-endpoints` is one
  store read (`JS_REF_READ_MAX`), so it applies one less than that as its value cap and the report
  names the cap that applied; `max_flows` does not bound it. The order is the walk's,
  first sighting wins. An empty source is a refusal, because a zero-request run reads as "nothing
  there".
- **Values are the captured value (P7).** A source does not trim, filter for framing bytes or
  re-encode. `param-values` are decoded once, as `Params` reads them, so a query or form position's
  own rule encodes them once; `path-segments` stay as captured, which is what a path position takes.
  A value holding CR, LF or NUL is kept and counted, because dropping it would decide for the operator
  which captured bytes are payloads.
- **Secrets are opt-in, and the opt-in is reported.** The default reads query, form, multipart and
  JSON only, and withholds any value `ParamInventory::Sensitivity` would mask (the same policy, now
  public, rather than a second list of secrets), a JavaScript endpoint with a credential-shaped
  segment included. Names are not withheld: a name is not a value. `extracted` is credential
  material by nature and refuses without the opt-in. Every report carries the policy and, on MCP,
  no value at all. The opt-in is an argument the caller passes, as `get_flow`'s `include_sensitive`
  is: an agent that may read a flow's raw headers may also ask for these, and the run says
  `SENSITIVE INCLUDED`.
- **Nothing live becomes durable.** `extracted` re-applies the stored extract rules (their host glob,
  their condition, `TokenExtract`) to stored responses, as a History display column does. The
  memory-only binding table (#501) is not read, and saving a list from project data is its own
  explicit act (`wordlist save --payload-from`, `save_wordlist{payload_from}`) that names the project.
  A value a one-value-per-line file cannot carry (it holds a line break) is left out of that save
  and counted, through `WordlistCatalog.one_per_line`: the predicate `save_values` refuses on, so
  what a file cannot hold is decided in one place.
- **A run with no named project reads nothing.** `--request` and stdin are deliberately outside any
  project, so a source there is refused rather than pointed at the most recent project.
- **Miner precedence is fixed.** Explicit names, the project's names, the built-in list, then the
  user wordlist, first sighting wins. The TUI Miner popup keeps its no-text-field rule and keeps
  seeding neighbour names itself; the Fuzzer's payload editor gets a Project type.
- **Left for later.** Provenance is per source (query, projection, counts), not per value; a
  per-value flow id would cost memory the caps are there to bound.

### 2026-09-29: a request-time macro is a gate on WHEN saved sessions run, and a failure is never a clean row (#1350)

Refines: [P1](#p1), [P6](#p6), [P7](#p7). Issue #1350, the follow-up to #1233.

A form token or nonce that rotates on every page load dies long before its session does, so #1233's
clock (`jwt-exp`, a `ttl`) cannot refresh it: a sweep gets `200` for its first candidate and `403`
for the rest, and reads as "the payloads were tried". A macro is a list of saved Repeater sessions a
Fuzzer or Miner run replays BEFORE a candidate. It adds no extraction and no injection mechanism.

- **Extraction and injection are the ones that exist.** The steps go through `Repeater::Plan`, so the
  existing extract rules (`TokenExtract`, `Bindings#observe`) rebind `$BIND.NAME`, and the candidate
  resolves it at send time (`Fuzz::Sender#send`) or through the active slot's header overlay. The
  placeholder is `$BIND.NAME`; `§…§` is a payload position, and reusing it for a non-fuzzing value
  would have made one marker mean two things. Steps are sent as the ACTIVE slot, overlay included,
  the opposite of a #1233 refresh, which must not carry the credential it replaces: a CSRF page
  needs the session the candidates are sent as, and the rebind lands in the table they resolve from.
- **`Config#request_macro` is the whole interface.** A surface parses its own input (`--macro*`,
  MCP `macro_*`, the ADVANCED rows / the mine popup) into a `RequestMacro::Spec`; `Plan.build`
  freezes the sessions, validates them, and builds a `Lane`. Nothing surface-specific exists below
  that line. The error is a `Gori::Error`, not a `PlanError::Reason` (three surfaces `case` that
  exhaustively, and the sentence names sessions and extract rules, which read the same everywhere);
  `Fuzz::ChainError` is the precedent.
- **An epoch is the unit of sharing, and a barrier is what makes it true.** `every N` means a value is
  used by the next N candidates; the steps of epoch k+1 do not start until every candidate of epoch
  k has left. Without the barrier, "N candidates share a value" is a hope: a slow candidate could
  pick up the next epoch's value at its send. The consequence is stated in the plan before the first
  request: `every 1` (the default) serialises the run, because a one-time value cannot be shared by
  two workers without changing the test, and `every N` leaves `min(concurrency, N)`. Candidates are
  counted in the order they reach the gate. A race is one unit (the steps run once, before the
  group is dialled) and the cadence must cover the group, or it is refused rather than silently
  shared. Answers to the issue's open questions: the steps run before the first candidate (it opens
  the first epoch); a failed macro skips the candidate or stops the run, and never sends the last
  value; `$BIND.NAME` only.
- **A failure is an error row, never a clean one.** The candidate is not sent; its row carries
  `RequestMacro::ERROR_PREFIX`, is counted in `errors`, and is not retried (the steps would fail again
  against the endpoint that just failed). A failed run opens no epoch, so the next candidate tries
  again. `skip` ends the run after `FAILURE_LIMIT` failures in a row (#1233's reasoning: a broken
  login must not be sent once per payload), `stop` on the first; ending a run is the engine's act,
  through the `ErrorEvent` every surface already turns into `error`. A budget spent or a stop between
  two steps is the run ending, not the macro breaking, and is not counted. There is no "send anyway
  with the last value": that row's verdict would be about a stale token.
- **The steps are the run's traffic.** Layer 1 at build and on every run (a scope edited mid-run
  stops the next one) and Layer 2 as `sweep_block`, not `send_block`: an automated sweep's traffic
  holds an operator's exclude. They are charged to `max_requests` through `Budget` (`CappedBackend`
  implements it, so `Progress#requests` counts them), held to the run's rate through its `pace`, and
  a stop lands between two steps. A Miner probe the gate refused after the cap had charged it is
  refunded, since the cap sits outside that decorator; a `reserve` that does not fit sticks
  `cap_reached?`, so that refund cannot reopen the budget and let the mine mark every remaining
  name tested. The plan-time race budget counts the macro's one run of steps with the group, and
  calibration holds back one candidate plus its steps, because neither can be split at the cap.
- **A macro that cannot change what is sent is refused.** Extraction and injection meet at a
  `$BIND.NAME` in the request the candidate goes out as. If no candidate can name a binding the steps
  rebind (a captured template is sent as captured and substitutes nothing, `Fuzz::Sender#evidence?`),
  every candidate would carry the stale value and the sweep would report `403` as verdicts, so the
  plan refuses, naming the two ways out. Same for a project with no enabled extract rule, and a step
  holding live `§…§` markers or a WebSocket handshake.
- **Where it hooks.** The Fuzzer gates each candidate attempt in the engine (`candidate_send`,
  `ws_send`, `race_send`, the calibration samples; not a redirect hop, which carries no template).
  The Miner has no fixed candidate list, so it gates each request the engine puts on the wire with a
  `Fuzz::Backend` decorator (`Miner::MacroBackend`), like `HookBackend`, which is what reaches the
  baseline: an app that rotates a token per request answers an un-tokened calibration probe with
  the same `403` as a candidate.
- **Visible, and never a value.** History rows with source `macro` (`source_ref` `macro step N`), one
  event per failure (capped per run), a plan line before the run, a tally in `Progress`. Messages carry
  binding names and counts. The TUI Miner popup, which has no text field, picks one saved session by
  id from the project; several steps and `expect` are CLI and MCP. Left for later: a per-slot
  macro (the steps a slot owns and a run can borrow); per-worker token contexts, which would let a
  per-request macro keep its concurrency for a target whose token is per connection rather than per
  session; and recording the macro on a saved fuzz run, which is a `fuzz_runs` column and so a
  schema change for a reporting field. Until then a saved run's macro is in the plan line it
  printed, the `macro`-sourced History rows, and the `macro:`-prefixed rows of any candidate it
  failed.

### 2026-09-30: a profile may serve a tool in one mode, and one table spells every argument alias (#1392–#1395)

Refines: [P1](#p1), [P4](#p4). `gori mcp` — `ToolFilter`, `Tools#tool`, `Tools#call`.

- **A profile can withhold arguments, and naming the tool lifts it.** `@recon` needed the passive
  `probe_scan` that fills the triage list it already carried, and not the active half that sends.
  Splitting the tool in two would have grown every catalogue to serve one profile, so a `Profile`
  carries `withheld` (tool → arguments): they leave that tool's emitted schema, so the argument
  validator — harvested from the same output — refuses them with no second list, and `Tools#call`
  answers a SET one with `TOOL_DISABLED` naming the spec (a `false` is dropped, since it asks for
  the mode that is served). The description has to follow the schema, or it advertises a refused
  mode. Any other term that selects the tool (a name, a glob, the "everything" a leading
  subtraction starts from) serves it whole: the profile is a default, the operator's term a decision.
- **Aliases are one table, advertised and folded, never `required`.** `Tools::ARG_ALIASES` names
  alias → canonical per tool. `tool` emits the alias as a copy of the canonical's schema (every
  schema is `additionalProperties:false`, so an unadvertised alias is refused client-side) and
  drops the canonical from `required`, because "one of these two" is not expressible at the top
  level in the schema subset clients accept and `required: ["id"]` rejects `{flow_id}`; `call`
  enforces the requirement instead, naming both. `call` folds the alias before dispatch, so no
  handler knows aliases exist; two spellings with different values are refused.
- **A read tool may write per call, and is then treated as a writer for that call.** `probe_scan`
  (`active`, now `persist`) was the one case; `export_openapi{output_path}` joins it. Such a tool
  is `read_only: false`, refused per call under `--read-only` and under the permission group the
  mode belongs to (`call_denied_permission`), and logged as an agent action per call
  (`agent_action?`) — while its report-only mode stays served everywhere.
- **The default body is small only when the rest is reachable.** `get_flow` and a recorded or saved
  `send_request` inline `AUTO_BODY_BYTES` of a body when the call names no size, with a `more`
  pointer to `get_response_body_chunk`. An unrecorded send keeps the full default: cutting a body
  there would leave its tail nowhere to be paged from. `outputSchema` and a shorter text form were
  declined: MCP says structured output SHOULD be mirrored in text, and gori declares no schema
  the `{items}` wrapper could contradict (see `Server#emit_structured`).

### 2026-09-30: a Sitemap root is an origin, and a tag still belongs to the host (#1371)

Refines: [P3](#p3), [P7](#p7). #1371, #1372.

The tree was rooted on the bare host, so `http://h:19021`, `http://h:19022` and `https://h:8443`
were one root: `paths` output could not be turned back into a URL, and every row action resolved
"the path on this host" to whichever service answered it last (Discover from a host row guessed
`https://<host>`). A root is now one ORIGIN — scheme, host and port (`Sitemap::Origin`, labelled
by `Url.authority`) — built from `Store#sitemap_origin_entries`, and everything read off a row
keeps to it: `representative_flow_id` and `js_ref_sightings` take the scheme and port, the
parameter inventory keys its rows by origin, the OpenAPI target set is keyed by `Sitemap::Origin`,
and the CLI and MCP narrow the same two reads with `--origin` / `origin`.

- **Identity and host questions are kept apart.** A row's identity (marks, anchors, expand
  state) is its root's label; a question a host answers — a `host` scope rule, a scope marker, a
  `string` scope seed (port-free by `QL::URL_EXPR_NO_PORT`) — is asked about `Node#host`. The
  label is display, never a key into host-keyed data.
- **A tag stays keyed on (host, path).** V17's key is the host, and `sitemap tag --host` and
  `set_sitemap_tag` name one. A memo therefore shows under every origin of its host, and a commit
  stamps all of them in place. Per-origin tags would be a key change on three surfaces and a
  schema version; nothing asked for one.
- **The host-level tree stays for the retest diff.** `Sitemap.build` over (host, method, target)
  triples is what `Diff::Templates` folds: it compares hosts across two engagements, where the
  ports a service ran on need not match. MCP `list_sitemap` keeps `collapse_transport` as its
  documented host-level merge.
- **A JavaScript reference is keyed by origin too (V43).** `js_refs` was `UNIQUE(host, path,
  flow_id)`, so a bundle naming `http://h:8080/p` and `https://h/p` kept one; the rebuild adds
  scheme and port and copies the rows as they are, so nothing is rescanned. A reference to an
  origin the tree lacks grows a root when its host is known, and not when that origin has captured
  traffic a lens hid (`JsRefNode#origin_captured`), which is re-derived after any delete: flow ids
  are never reused (V39), so rows were deleted exactly when the count grew by less than the
  newest id did.
- **Cost.** The origin read selects five columns of the same covering index; at 100k flows it is
  6.6 ms against the host read's 4.5 ms, on a reload that runs only while the tab is active. With
  hide-static on it reads the wide index rather than `idx_flows_sitemap_nonstatic`, which lacks
  scheme and port; widening that index is a migration of its own and was not needed to stay
  covering and sort-free.

### 2026-09-30: `gori run` defaults are for scripts: a pinned default project, one JSON shape, curl's letters (#1383, #1386, #1387)

Refines: [P1](#p1), [P7](#p7). Issues #1383–#1389, from dogfooding 0.7.1.

A script reads what the CLI prints and nothing else, so a default a human would notice and correct
is a default a script silently obeys. Three were wrong in that way.

- **The default project is pinned, not guessed.** "Most recently active" is a fact about the last
  WRITE, so `notes create --project demo` re-aimed every later `--project`-less command. The CLI now
  reads, in order, `GORI_PROJECT` and a persisted `gori run project switch` pin before that fallback
  (`CLI::Run.default_project`), and a pin that names nothing is REFUSED, never skipped — falling
  through to the recent project is exactly the re-aim the pin exists to stop. This is `gori run`
  resolution only: `ProjectRegistry.default_of` is unchanged, the TUI opens what the operator picks,
  and MCP keeps its own binding (`GORI_MCP_PROJECT`, the workspace). Not done: making an explicit
  `--project` write leave the recent-project order alone; that order is the db's mtime, shared with
  the TUI picker, and the pin makes it irrelevant to a script.
- **`json` is one document, `jsonl` is lines, on every command.** `history` and `capture` answered
  `json` with JSON Lines while every other command answered with an array, so `| jq length` meant
  two things. Streaming stays streaming: `history` writes its array row by row, and `capture` opens
  its array at once and closes it from the printer's `ensure` on `--for`, `--max` or a signal, so
  what a consumer collects is always one document. `fuzz`'s array is written in index order through
  a reorder buffer that holds only the concurrency window. `--json` is registered by the same
  helper as `--format` (`CLI::Run.format_flag`) so it cannot be missing from a new command.
- **A curl-shaped command takes curl's letters.** `gori run send` borrowed curl's shape and gave
  `-b` the body; a curl user's `-b 'admin=1'` became a body on a GET. `-d` is the body now (POST and
  a form Content-Type unless `-X`/`-H` say otherwise), `-b` the cookie, joined with curl's `;`. A
  `-b` value with no `=` — a cookie-jar file to curl, and the shape of an old `-b '{"a":1}'` body —
  is refused rather than sent. The defaults live in the CLI's option handling, not in
  `Repeater::UrlRequest.structured`, which MCP shares and whose `body` never meant curl's `-d`.

Two shared seams moved down to make the parity real rather than copied: the send-error classifier
(`Repeater::SendError`, formerly MCP's `network_error_kind`/`send_error_code`/`send_retryable?`) and
Match & Replace for a direct send (`Repeater::RequestRules`, formerly MCP's
`maybe_apply_request_rules`). Renaming the flags whose meaning differs across commands (`--target`,
`--header`, `-n`, `--unsafe`, `--owner/--id`) is left to additive aliases; a rename would break the
scripts this entry is about.

### 2026-09-30: TUI key routes stop at the owning scope, and hints follow live bindings (#1374, #1375)

Refines: the 2026-09-25 R1 entry above.

- A focused sub-tab strip answers its raw navigation and mark keys, then resolves an unhandled
  chord in `Scope::Global` only. The active tab and Editor scopes never receive a strip key.
- Key chips and help text that name a rebindable action derive the key from the registry. When a
  pane is unfocused, its state chips name the state instead of implying its key is active there.
- Intercept's empty-state card only shows forward, drop, filter and direction keys while its body
  is focused; otherwise it tells the operator to focus the body first.
- `↑` at the first line in Repeater INS is editor motion; only READ mode can hand that edge to
  the focus ring. Capture-off is a yellow `OFF` signal in the top-bar listener chip.

### 2026-09-30: cancelling a one-shot MCP send closes its socket (#1391)

Refines: [P4](#p4), [P1](#p1). MCP `notifications/cancelled` (#1391).

The 2026-09-20 cancellation decision treated `send_request` and `send_websocket` as indivisible
one-shot work. That left a silent origin holding the only MCP worker until its timeout, blocking
every later tool call even though the reader had already handled the cancellation. The request's
own cancellation remains cooperative: while an HTTP or WebSocket engine owns its one-shot socket,
a bounded watcher polls the same non-consuming predicate and closes that socket when the client
cancels. HTTPS has two ownership phases: the shared dial watches the underlying transport socket
while OpenSSL performs the TLS handshake, then the sender watches the completed SSL socket during
the exchange. TCP connect itself keeps its existing timeout. The watcher is joined before the
engine returns, so cancellation releases both the connection and its fiber; no default timeout
changes. Loopback TLS specs cover a silent post-handshake read and an origin that stalls after
ClientHello, including the SSL close-from-watcher path. The server still emits no response for a
cancelled JSON-RPC id, as required by MCP.

**The worker stays serial.** `Store` reads have a WAL pool and writes still funnel through its
single writer, but the shared `Tools` instance also carries per-call cancellation state, current
project bindings, and operator-note claims. Running nominally read-only calls beside a send would
need a broader per-call state and project-switching design; closing the canceled send already lets
the queued call proceed promptly without adding that concurrency surface.

### 2026-09-30: denied MCP permissions leave a bounded Activity marker

An attempted call to a switched-off Preferences permission is evidence that the operator's gate
refused an action, even though no handler ran. Record it as `agent_permission_denied`, separate
from `agent_action` so readers do not treat a refusal as executed work. Keep only the tool and
permission group; never persist the call arguments. Coalesce repeated denials for the same
tool/group for the lifetime of that MCP server's binding to a project, so a retry loop writes one
row rather than one per call. The existing project event retention remains the outer disk bound.
The globally read-only MCP mode has a read-only store and therefore cannot write this marker;
neither can an unbound server with no project event feed.

### 2026-09-30: a bare-LF response head is accepted, framed off its LF reading, and never reused

Refines: [P7](#p7), and the response half of the framing rule (`Http1.framing_ambiguous?`).

An origin that ends its response-head lines on a bare LF (`HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n…\n\nbody`) was
never framed: every head reader stopped only on CRLFCRLF, so a close-delimited origin's reply
reached the client as nothing and a keep-alive one stalled to the head deadline, while the same
page rendered direct. RFC 9112 §2.2 lets a recipient accept a lone LF and browsers do; embedded
devices and legacy CGI are exactly what an operator points gori at.

- **Responses only.** `Http1.read_response_head_result` is the one upstream response reader (the
  proxy, `Repeater::Engine` and so every active tool, the WebSocket handshake) and also ends a
  head on its EARLIEST blank line, `\n\n`, `\r\n\n` and `\n\r\n` included — once a start-line
  has arrived, so a stray `\n\n` in front of the next response is read past as before. A request
  head stays CRLFCRLF-only: its peer is the operator's own client, which is why the request rule
  is the blunt one.
- **A CRLF-only reader is still a party.** It does not stop at a bare-LF blank line; it reads on
  to the next CRLFCRLF (`…\r\nX: a\n\r\nContent-Length: 5\r\n\r\n`). When that CRLFCRLF is
  already buffered and the two readings frame the body differently, the reader returns the
  LONGER head, which then parses strictly and is refused by `framing_ambiguous?`. "Differently"
  is the framing values disagreeing, or, with the same values, a body being declared at all
  (a Content-Length other than 0, any Transfer-Encoding): the body then starts at a different
  byte for each reader. With no body declared only the head/body split inside the one message
  differs — a close-delimited body ends at the close for every reader, a length-0 one ends at
  gori's head and the rest stays on a connection gori retires and flags — so that head is
  kept. The same rule now covers a CRLFCRLF head that a lenient reader ends early, which main
  forwarded framed by the longer head. The cost, accepted: an
  LF-only head that declares a length, followed in the same segment by a body holding a CRLF
  blank line, is refused too, because a strict reader genuinely frames that message otherwise.
  A CRLFCRLF not yet buffered cannot be seen; the next two points bound that.
- **The terminator picks the reading.** `parse_response_head` reads a head ENDED on a bare-LF
  blank line on LF (a CR before the LF goes with it); every other head keeps the strict CRLF
  scan, including a CRLFCRLF head with a bare LF inside, which `framing_ambiguous?` keeps
  comparing as before. For an LF-terminated head the comparison is between two LF-lenient
  readers, and a lone CR, an obs-fold or whitespace before the colon on a framing header is
  still refused. Stored heads take the same parse, so Probe, export, evidence and MCP see the
  status and headers, and `strip_header_lines` (Alt-Svc, WebSocket extensions) walks the same
  lines, so it still never sees a field the parse does not.
- **Bytes stay as they came.** Nothing rewrites an LF to CRLF, on the wire or in the capture.
  Response Match&Replace is not applied to such a head (the flow says so): every rewrite helper
  frames a head as CRLF lines, and a rewritten bare-LF head ends somewhere else for the client.
  A held one is split at the same blank line the reader used (`Http1.response_head_end`).
- **One response per connection.** A connection on which any head of the exchange (an interim
  1xx included) ended on a bare-LF blank line is never reused (`ClientConn#origin_keep_alive?`,
  `ConnPool.reusable_response?` via `Result#lf_framed?`), and the proxy checks the retired
  socket for bytes waiting past the framed body without blocking (`Proxy::SocketResidue`, the
  pool's checkout probe, moved under the proxy for this) and says so on the flow — the leftover
  can no longer surface as the next request's response. `send_pipeline` is left alone (a group
  send on one socket is the operator's own desync test); Probe's request_smuggling treats a
  bare-LF leg of its differential as inconclusive rather than a Critical.
- **Visible.** Probe's passive `bare_lf_response` flags any bare LF in a response head.

h2 has no line endings and is unaffected.

### 2026-10-01: a held message is evidence; the intercept editor expands only the names the operator typed (#1416)

Refines: [P7](#p7), and the parity invariant for the intercept edit (AGENTS.md "Three surfaces").

The TUI intercept editor ran the `$ENV`/`$GEN` pass, with every escape consumed, over the whole
buffer, and that buffer is seeded from the held message's own bytes. So appending one byte to a
request line substituted a project secret into a captured `a=$ENV.FOO`, minted a value for a
captured `$GEN.UUID`, turned `pa$$word` into `pa$word`, and resynced Content-Length to match —
for a held response too. CLI `intercept edit` and MCP `intercept_forward_edit` forward verbatim,
so the same edit put different bytes on the wire depending on the surface.

- **Per name, the Repeater's evidence rule.** A name the held message arrived with stays literal
  (`Env.literal_keys` of the seed, passed to `Env.expand_wire(literal:)`, which covers GEN as
  well as ENV in the one pass); a name the operator types is still a reference, which keeps
  #524's typed `Authorization: Bearer $ENV.TOKEN`. When a typed name collides with a captured
  one, gori cannot tell the occurrences apart and evidence wins. The set is re-derived from the
  seed bytes on `Env.highlight_rev`, and the editor is handed the same bytes to paint.
- **No escape is consumed** (`unescape: Owns::None`): a `$$` in captured bytes is two bytes the
  client sent. The accepted cost is the one every evidence path already pays — an operator's own
  `$$ENV.X` is forwarded as typed.
- **Not head-only.** Expanding the head and treating the body as bytes would still substitute
  into a client header or query string that carries `$ENV.X`; the axis is provenance, not where
  in the message the byte sits.
- **The surfaces still differ, by design and only there.** CLI and MCP expand nothing; the TUI
  additionally resolves names the operator typed into the held message. Neither expands or
  unescapes a `$` the client sent (both still resync Content-Length and promote the head's bare
  LFs, which are the edit's framing, not its tokens).

### 2026-10-02: READ-mode editors delete and paste; `dd`/`yy` are a two-press operator, not a chord

Refines: the 2026-09-12 keyset entry (a keyset is a mapping) and R1 of "one bare letter, one
question". Both said there is no delete in a READ pane, so a keyset had nothing to put on `dd`.
The operator asked for the edit itself: in gori's helix grammar, select and then act (`x` then
`d` / `y`, and `p`); under the vim keyset, `dd`, `yy` and `p`.

- **One engine, replayed through the pane's own key path** (`Tui::ReadEdit`). A READ-mode edit
  enters INSERT, hands the span to the editor, and replays ⌫ or a paste through the same
  `handle_key` a refused bulk paste uses (`Runner#replay_paste`). It never splices a buffer
  itself, because eight panes each do their own work after an edit — Content-Length, the
  Fuzzer's `§` guard, a note's save — and a direct splice would skip it. `p` is therefore the
  operator's own paste in every respect P7 cares about. Leaving INSERT goes through the pane's
  `editor_exit_insert`, which now does what `esc` does everywhere: an Issue's notes save there,
  and a save refused over a peer's rewrite keeps INSERT and its own message.
- **The paste register is gori's own** (`Tui::Register`), filled by every `Clipboard.copy` and
  every READ-mode delete. It does not read the system clipboard: OSC 52's read half is refused
  or prompted for by most terminals, and `pbpaste`/`wl-paste` exist on no SSH session. Outside
  text still arrives by terminal paste, which opens INSERT (#1124). A delete fills the register
  only, so it never overwrites the operator's system clipboard. Whole-line copies and deletes
  are LINEWISE and paste as lines below the caret's line; the writer states it.
- **`dd` / `yy` are held by the Runner, not the keymap.** `editor.delete-line` and
  `editor.yank-line` are keyless verbs the vim keyset puts on `d` and `y`; the first press arms
  (`Runner#finish_editor_op`), the same verb again runs it on the caret's line, `esc` cancels,
  and any other key cancels with a word. The second press is taken ahead of the digit family,
  so `d2` cannot jump to tab 2. There are no motions after an operator, no counts and no named
  registers: `dw` is cancelled, not guessed at.
- **R1 gains a rule-based exemption, `EDITOR_EDITS`** (`spec/tui/menu_letter_meaning_spec.cr`).
  Inside a text editor `d`, `y` and `p` are the editor's letters. A dropped `space` before the
  menu's `d` (Duplicate, Delete issue) or `y` (Copy) edits or copies the text in that pane: one
  buffer, undoable (a delete in one `^Z`, a paste the way a terminal paste in that pane undoes),
  and a toast that says what happened. The set names verbs, and the guard holds
  each member to Scope::Editor, READ-only availability and the `:none` band; it is never a send,
  a triage or a wipe. The same pass stopped treating a row drawn only on the sub-tab strip as an
  editor view, since `Runner#editor_pane?` needs body focus.
- **The verbs never gate on "is there a selection".** A false `available?` would let `d` fall to
  the tab's own `d`, which deletes the selected flow, issue or rule in sixteen scopes. In an
  editor pane the letter is the editor's; a `d` with nothing to delete says so.

### 2026-10-03: how far the vim keyset goes, and the four tests a new vim key has to pass

Refines: the 2026-09-12 keyset entry and the 2026-10-02 READ-edit entry. gori is a proxy whose
text panes hold requests, notes and tokens; a vim hand should not trip on its reflexes there,
but gori is not becoming vim. A review of the keyset found it short on the basics: `h`/`l`
moved only in the Repeater, a line selection grown by one row cut mid-line on a delete, and
`esc` left the pane with the selection still armed for the next `d`. Fixing those and adding
`w`/`b` and `⇧A`/`⇧I` drew the line this entry records. A vim key is added only when it passes
all four:

1. **The operation already exists in the editors.** The keyset names keys; it does not grow
   editing operations (2026-09-12). `w`/`b` are the editor's ⌥←/→ word step; `⇧A`/`⇧I` are
   End/Home then INSERT, as `a` is one column then INSERT. `e` (end of word) has no such
   operation and is not offered.
2. **One keystroke, or the one two-press operator.** `dd`/`yy` stay the only sequences
   (2026-10-02). No counts, no motion after an operator, no text objects, no `.` repeat, no
   `:` commands. `g` alone is the top.
3. **It takes no key gori already answers in that pane.** A menu letter it meets is fine when
   the vim key only moves, selects or starts typing (`VIM_MOTIONS`); a live binding is not.
   That is why `$` (it arrives as ⇧4, the Global sub-tab jump) and `0` (Go to tab) are left
   to End and Home.
4. **A vim hand does it without thinking in a pane holding a request.** Move, select a line,
   delete or yank it, paste, undo, find, start typing. `x`, `o`/`O`, `J`, `r`, `c`, `v`,
   `n`/`N`, marks and macros fail this test or test 1, and stay in INSERT or out.

Where a fix is not vim-specific it is not keyset-gated: `h j k l` in every READ pane, a line
selection that stays whole lines under ⇧↑/⇧↓, and `esc` over a READ selection clearing it
(`Runner#handle_key`, ahead of every pane's own `esc`) apply under both keysets. The one
vim-only behaviour is the plain `j`/`k` that grows a `⇧V` selection, which is what makes `V`
usable at all, and with it `g`/`⇧G` grow the selection to an edge (`V` `G` `d`); the keyset
is named at select time (`TextReadState#select_line`), so the wizard's practice pad answers in
the keyset it is showing. At a pane's first or last line a held `⇧V` counts as a selection
being grown (`TabController#editor_line_held?`, ORed into each READ ladder's `selecting`), so
`k`/`j` there stay in the pane instead of handing focus on with the lines still armed; ⇧↑/⇧↓
follow the same rule in every ladder now, as Project and Issues already documented.

Discoverability goes to a playground in Preferences → Keys (the wizard's pad plus each
keyset's full key list), not to more keys. It only tries: the keyset is set on the row above
it, and a second setter in the card was one more way for the two to disagree.

### 2026-10-03: Repeater scope follows the final request-target

Refines: [§3](#s3) and the 2026-09-03 `verbatim` entry above.

That entry deliberately left Layer 1 on `Plan#bytes` while Layer 2 followed the send seam, to
avoid matching a path include against a live binding. The split let a strict MCP or CLI scope
allow a draft path and then send a different, binding-expanded path. Every up-front Layer-1
gate (MCP, `gori run`, Retest, macros, session refresh) now reads `Plan#scope_requests`, the
same side-effect-free prediction Layer 2 already used, so a refused send fires no session
refresh first. `Repeater::Sender` repeats Layer 1 on the real wire, which a refresh can still
move. Refusals never print the expanded target. `verbatim` still decides whether bindings
resolve; when they do, the scope rule follows the bytes that leave gori.

### 2026-10-04: the held Intercept editor opens in READ, and catch holds requests by default

Refines: the 2026-09-12 entry "the editor keys are verbs, and the focus dimension is a scope at
the head of the chain", which the Intercept's held-message editor had never joined.

A first-time walkthrough found two Intercept defaults that disagreed with the rest of gori.
`⇥` into the held message opened it in INS, so the `i` that the tour, the Repeater and the
Fuzzer all teach as "enter INS" became a byte (`iGET /…`). The pane now opens in READ when the
focus ring enters it, through the same `EditorPane` / `TextReadState` seam the Repeater and
Fuzzer use: it joins `Scope::Editor`, `i`/`↵` enter INS, `esc` steps INS → READ → queue, and
the border draws the real mode. `↵`/`e` on the queue still mean "edit" and go straight to INS.
Holding is unchanged. READ navigation and selection leave the buffer alone; the READ edits
(`d`, `p`, `dd`, undo) reach it through `Scope::Editor`, which replays them through the pane's
own INS path (`ReadEdit`), so they mark the hold edited exactly as typing does. A forward of a
hold nobody edited is still the held bytes verbatim (P7).

Catch defaulted to both legs, so forwarding a request held its response too and the client hung
until a second `f`, while the tour said "Intercept holds each request". The default is now
requests only, and `c` cycles requests → responses → both. An explicitly chosen direction
(TUI, `gori run intercept direction`, MCP `intercept_set_direction`) behaves exactly as before.
The cost is that a `status:` condition, which only a response can match, now needs `c` set to
responses or both before it holds anything. Every surface says so rather than refusing it, since
either half can change next: the TUI condition bar and its toasts, and a `note` beside the
`intercept_set_filter` / `intercept_set_direction` ack and on `gori run intercept filter` /
`direction` (`Interceptor.direction_note`, over `InterceptFilter.response_fields`).

### 2026-10-04: the setup wizard no longer asks for an editor keyset

Reverses the wizard's KEYS step (#1462); the keyset itself and the Preferences → Keys
playground (2026-10-03 entry above) are unchanged.

A first run asked "how should a text editor's READ keys feel?" with a practice pad, before the
user had opened a single editor. That is jargon and a decision a beginner cannot make yet, and
the default (helix-ish) serves them fine. The wizard is now NETWORK → THEME → COMPANION →
REVIEW and never writes `editor_keyset`, so re-running `gori wizard` keeps a choice made in
Preferences. REVIEW's Editor keys row shows the saved keyset and the palette entry that changes it
(Settings: Keys, its title read from the registry; no chord, since REVIEW's Shortcuts row can
change the palette's modifier before finish). MIN_H stays 15: REVIEW was already the tallest step.
